With the bear market in full swing, a large number of cryptocurrencies remain at risk of losing more of their value. However, for Ethereum, there could be a bull trend on the horizon and it has to do with staking on the network.\nShanghai Upgrade Will Drive Ethereum Up\nCurrently, compared to the other Layer 1 proof of stake networks in the sector, Ethereum sees the lowest percentage of supply staked. At less than 14 of ETH supply being staked, it comes down to there not being a withdrawal mechanism for those who stake on the network but this could change very soon and bring with it renewed vigor to the market.\nThe Ethereum “Shanghai” upgrade is expected to take place sometime in March 2023 and a Matrixport report shared with NewsBTC via email expects this to be a bull trigger for the digital asset. As it puts it, “it seems extremely likely that more ETH will be staked after March and this could put upward pressure on ETH prices.”\nThe reasoning behind this is a simple one; the more ETH is staked, the less supply in the market, and scarcity leads to higher prices. Instead of staked ETH volume actually declining, it is expected to increase because once withdrawals are possible, investors will be more confident to stake their coins, knowing that they can easily get it back.\n“With more ETH being staked and removed from circulation, the downside price pressure seems limited as long as ETH remains staked.”\nAnother Rally To $1,600 for ETH\nThe report further elaborates on its expected price reaction for Ethereum following the “Shanghai” upgrade. It notes that the digital asset is already breaking out of its sideways consolidation which is a good thing as such a breakout from previous consolidations had seen ETH rally as high as 39% in 2022.\nETH jumps above $1,250 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\nSo if another breakout such as this were to take place, it is possible that the digital asset could see an over 27% increase just like it did in October 2022. This would obviously bring its price back up to $1,600 with a 27% rally, and above $1,750 with a 39% rally. It also predicts lower volatility for the year 2023, but still expects investors to see a 9.8% increase with a 63% implied volatility for March 23.\nBesides the factors outlined in the Matrixport report, another thing that could support this bull case is a “buy the rumor” event. These often occur leading up to important upgrades such as “Shanghai” where investors capitalize on the anticipation to drive the price of a digital asset up. Therefore, in the months and weeks leading up to the upgrade in March, multiple rallies could be triggered which would bring ETH’s price to at least $1,500."}, {"date": "2023-01-05 22:19:48", "entity": ["bzeih", "fiat 500", "microsoft", "microsoft", "metaverse company"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "One example he pointed to is the way consumers buy cars today.

TRON aims to become the primary settlement layer of the global economy. As the global trend-setter in cryptocurrency, TRON is developing an ecosystem infrastructure that will be able to serve every human on the planet.\nAbout TRON DAO\nTRON DAO is a community-governed DAO dedicated to accelerating the decentralization of the internet via blockchain technology and dApps.\nFounded in September 2017 by H.E. Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of January 2023, it has over 133 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.5 billion total transactions, and over $9.2 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\nTRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum\nContact\nHayward Wong"}, {"date": "2023-01-05 19:08:55", "entity": ["meme coins", "bonk", "solana", "aficionados", "jokey vibe", "sol", "dour vibes", "bonk", "bonk", "bitcoin", "solana", "sol", "solana", "coin", "ftx", "bonk", "solana", "solana", "lamportdao", "coingecko", "ethereum", "shiba inu", "dogecoin", "coingecko", "bonk"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Meme coins and tokens are famously volatile, surging and falling based on things like social media sentiment—as seen in many past occasions with Elon Musk and Dogecoin. Now BONK, a Solana-based, dog-themed token, is experiencing that same kind of turbulent momentum, falling by over half today after ascending to an all-time high price overnight.\nBONK has surged over the past week, fueled by Solana developers and aficionados that are embracing the jokey vibe and memey nature after months of declining value for SOL and dour vibes around the ecosystem. On Wednesday and into early Thursday, the token more than tripled in price, peaking at $0.00000487 per data from CoinGecko.\nAD\nAD\nBut Wednesday’s rise has given way to a sharp Thursday fall, with the token dipping as low as $0.00000223 this morning—a 54% drop in less than 11 hours.\nIt recalls the vast swings seen by other meme coins in the past, such as the Ethereum-based Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin, and shorter-lived phenomena like Floki Inu (FLOKI). All of them are inspired in part by the Shiba Inu dog from the classic “doge” meme, which has been embraced by the crypto world.\nHowever, BONK is already rebounding, popping back up to $0.00000315 as of this writing. And even with the sizable drop, BONK is vastly outperforming all major cryptocurrencies this week. The token is up more than 3,300% over the last week, and still retains a 42% gain over the past 24 hours. Bitcoin, by comparison, is up just 2% this week.\nThe biggest beneficiaries are developers and creators that are building on Solana, as well as collectors of some popular NFT projects on the platform. BONK was launched last month and half of the 100 trillion token supply was airdropped for free to the community, including builders and collectors.\nFor example, some Solana app builders who joined LamportDAO—a hub for developers—each received 5 billion BONK on December 25. It was valued at less than $1,000 worth of the token on that date. But at the peak price last night, that stash would have been worth almost $122,000.\nCurrent status of crypto twitter pic.twitter.com/ZRqBZhBDMz — Alan Carroll (@alancarroII) January 5, 2023\nFree crypto money may have fueled the initial momentum around BONK, but traders betting on a “degen” meme coin play undoubtedly helped to push its price to the recent peak. CoinGecko showed surging trading volume for BONK last night at a significant multiple of previous levels, with 24-hour volume peaking around $230 million overnight.\nMomentum around BONK is also fueling a price surge for Solana itself, which fell to a nearly two-year low of $8.17 last week. Now SOL is trading for more than $13 again, per CoinGecko, up 34% on the week.\nAD\nAD\nSolana (SOL) is still down 95% from its own peak of $260 in November 2021, and the coin and ecosystem alike were especially hard hit by the impact of FTX’s collapse in November. But as silly as it may seem, BONK is pumping fresh life into the Solana space at the start of 2023."}, {"date": "2023-01-05 18:37:11", "entity": ["ftx"], "sentiment": ["Negative"], "content": "Anyone Who Took Money From FTX Ought to Repay It\nIt was never Sam Bankman-Fried's to spend."}, {"date": "2023-01-05 18:27:28", "entity": ["binance", "stablecoins", "binance"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The recent decline in the amount of BUSD outstanding wiped out the gains that came after Binance’s move in September to ditch several rival stablecoins and automatically convert deposits into BUSD; Binance officials described the move as an attempt to consolidate trading pairs on its exchange platform.

The regulatory watchdog raised some concerns about the Binance takeover and asked for more clarification on the deal.\nSpecifically, the SEC wanted to know how the crypto exchange planned to compensate the users of Voyager Digital who still have funds stuck on the platform. In addition to objecting due to a lack of “necessary information,” the regulator also raised objections about the ability of Binance.US to finance an acquisition of this magnitude. It also asked for clarification about how the crypto exchange will operate once it takes control of Voyager’s assets.\nAnother interesting fact in the case is the fact that subject to court approval, Binance.US would actually have to complete the purchase by April 18, four months from now. The SEC is seeking clarification on what the crypto exchange would do if it is unable to close the deal by this date.\nTotal market cap at $778 billion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission was not alone in this. The Texas Securities Board had also taken an oppositional stand against the crypto exchange’s deal, filing a joint objection with the Texas Department of Banking.\nUnlike the SEC’s objections, the state regulator was more skewed toward protecting the interest of Voyager customers in the state. It explained that since both parties in the deal were not keeping in compliance with Texan business law and are therefore not authorized to conduct business in the state, it was objecting to the sale of the assets.\nAdditionally, the Texas regulator also said that it objected to “disparate treatment provided to creditors in certain states.” This can be interpreted as speculations of favorable treatment to Voyager creditors in some states at the expense of others.\nBinance.US has not responded to any of the filings, and the court hearing is expected to carry on today, January 5. The crypto exchange had already made a $10 million deposit as a token of “good faith” to help Voyager with expenses.

Instead, they can mint and list NFTs through their existing storefront through one of Shopify’s blockchain apps. Thanks to Venly, those NFTs can now be minted on Avalanche.\nVenly, a blockchain tech startup, announced the expansion of Avalanche support today through its Shopify NFT minting app. The layer-1 blockchain platform, which is billed as a faster and cheaper alternative to top NFT platform Ethereum, was previously only accessible to select Shopify users but is now offered to any merchant on the platform.\nAD\nAD\nShopify is a major ecommerce platform that powers online storefronts for millions of sellers around the world, the company claims. CEO Tobi Lütke is a Web3 advocate who also serves on the board of directors at crypto exchange Coinbase.\nBuyers won't need to have an existing Avalanche wallet to purchase an NFT, according to Venly, nor do they need to handle cryptocurrency. Instead, they can pay with fiat money (such as with a credit card) and then will receive a link to a newly-created Avalanche wallet with the freshly minted NFT inside, which they can then transfer elsewhere if they please.\nVenly, which was founded in 2018 and also offers blockchain wallet solutions, is one of several blockchain app partners integrated within the Shopify ecosystem. Other partners have provided tools for users to mint NFTs on blockchain platforms like Ethereum and Flow in the past.\nTim Dierckxsens, co-founder and CEO of Venly, told Decrypt that it first offered NFT minting tools to brands and artists on Shopify, but that it saw growing demand for a simple, no-code tool that any seller could use to create NFTs. He said that Shopify asked Venly to develop an app for its merchants to enable streamlined NFT sales to mainstream users.\n“I believe it's one of the biggest evolutions [for NFTs] where this can be taken to a mass market,” Dierckxsens told Decrypt, “and you don't need to understand the necessity of crypto to make the purchase.”\nShopify merchants can sell NFT collectibles through Venly, as well as offer NFT token-gated experiences, or tie NFTs to physical products for authentication, along with other potential use cases. Dierckxsens also believes that there’s significant potential for creators and artists to sell NFTs through social media channels that can integrate or point to Shopify stores.\n“Our growing blockchain ecosystem demonstrates our commitment to supporting merchants as they sell NFTs directly through their storefronts, helping to further grow participation in Web3 and expand what’s possible in commerce,” said Shopify Blockchain Ecosystem Lead Christina Lomazzo in a release.\nVenly first launched its Shopify NFT minting tool on Polygon, the Ethereum scaling network, in late 2021. Avalanche is the second network to be supported, and Dierckxsens said that Venly is planning to add support for NFTs minted through Hedera and Ethereum scaling network Immutable X in the future.\nAD\nAD\nFocusing on layer-1 platforms and Ethereum layer-2 networks with low gas fees for customers is intentional, he told Decrypt. Ethereum mainnet gas fees can vary widely and be costly, even if they don’t appear to swing as violently as they did during the initial NFT buying frenzy of 2021.\n“You cannot sell a mass market item and expect end users to pay around $20 to $100 in transaction fees,” Dierckxsens said.\nAlthough NFT trading volume on the platform is relatively low—about $1.2 million worth in December, per data from CryptoSlam—Avalanche has seen growing NFT adoption over the last year.

On January 4, a New York judge ruled in Celsius’s favor, establishing its rights to earn deposits on interest-bearing accounts held on the lending platform. This spells bad news for the customers as this means that Celsius Earn account holders can only get a fraction of their initial investment back.\nCelsius is also currently under fire because of its pending bills with the mining company Core Scientific. According to an agreement between the two, Core Scientific has turned off power to 37,000 mining rigs belonging to Celsius due to non-payment of electricity bills.\nJudge Rules In Favor Of Celsius\nThe company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy back in July 2022 after taking major hits in the Terra LUNA debacle. According to the bankruptcy filings, the Celsius platform held around 600,000 accounts with total assets valued at a sizeable $4.2 billion. The latest ruling comes from bankruptcy judge Martin Glenn, who referenced the company’s terms and conditions and declared that the funds in Earn accounts were company property.\nThe judge ruled,\n“The Court concludes, based on Celsius’s unambiguous Terms of Use … that when the cryptocurrency assets were deposited in Earn Accounts, the cryptocurrency assets became Celsius’s property; and the cryptocurrency assets remaining in the Earn Accounts on the Petition Date became property of the Debtors’ bankruptcy estates.”\nAccording to the judge, the company’s terms of service clearly stated that all customer deposits into Earn Accounts were under the company’s ownership and would be treated as unsecured creditors in bankruptcy proceedings. This means that repaying these customers is not high on Celsius’s priority list and that the company will repay its higher-priority debts first with the available funds.\nPreviously Directed To Return Funds\nHowever, it is interesting to note that Judge Martin Glenn had previously directed Celsius to refund customer funds. Not long ago, in December 2022, Judge Glenn addressed the lending platform and advised it to return investors’ money.\nJudge said,\n“I want this case to move forward. I want creditors to recover as much as they possibly can as soon as they possibly can.”\nThe judge had also stated that the funds held in escrow accounts must be returned to customers, even if they did not enter the company’s interest-bearing accounts.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

If the first of these companies decides to liquidate one of their products to pay off their debt, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will likely trend to the downside. Deribit noted:\nThe Option market is dismissing material directional reaction to the Gemini-DCG deadline, and the relatively flat Skew across Terms is not signaling strong bias.\nImplied Volatility, a measure of the market’s expectation around price movement, has declined.

In the update, the La Jolla, California company said crypto deposits had dropped to just $3.8 billion in the final three months of last year, compared to almost $12 billion in the prior quarter.\nAD\nAD\n“This [past year] was a much more widespread deleveraging of the ecosystem that obviously culminated with the collapse of FTX,” Alan Lane, chief executive of Silvergate said on a call following the announcement. “When you put all of that in context, what we have seen is a lot of institutional players—there's just been this crisis of confidence.”\nFollowing the collapse of FTX and the resulting domino effect of failures across the crypto ecosystem, Silvergate said $150 million of its deposits were from customers that have filed for bankruptcy.\nDiem done?\nNow the bank has announced that it will lay off 200 employees, roughly 40% of its workforce. In a statement issued to the stock market on Thursday, Silvergate said it had increased headcount “at a rapid rate” last year, but now needed to adjust to the “economic realities facing the digital asset industry today”.\nThe layoffs will cost $8 million to complete, but Lane said it was “too early” to say how much money they would save the company.\nThe group will also abandon certain projects, including its plans for a blockchain-based payment solution. The decision means it will take a $196 million write-down on technology it purchased from Meta’s failed Diem project.\n“There are still people on the project,” Lane said in regard to Diem. “As we sit here today, we will obviously have to continue to evaluate.”\nLane added that in the current operating environment, \"it's going to be really challenging to bring a tokenized dollar [...] to market anytime soon.\nSilvergate had already exited a mortgage warehouse lending business late last year, due to rising interest rates and falling mortgage volumes.\nAD\nAD\n“At this point we’re not able to comment on whether the first quarter will actually be profitable,” Lane said on the call.\nHe described where the company’s deposits will be in the future as a “wild card.”\n“It wasn’t too long ago that we as a company were at this very level in terms of deposit levels and employee headcount,” he said, adding that the company looks similar to how it did two years ago.\nShares in the NYSE-listed corporation dropped more than 40% in pre-market trading following the update.\nSilvergate and FTX\nCollapsed crypto exchange FTX accounted for around $1 billion of the assets held by Silvergate from digital asset customers by the end of 2022’s third quarter.\nLane said at the time of FTX’s implosion in November that the relationship between the two was “limited to deposits”.\nBut this did not stop analysts from Morgan Stanley from downgrading their rating on the business last month, as they predicted a slump in deposits amid the FTX fallout.\nThe company has also found itself on the receiving end of a class-action lawsuit alleging that it breached its fiduciary duty with respect to deposits made by FTX and its sister firm Alameda Research. Other law firms are also putting together possible legal action.\nAnswering a question on Thursday’s call about the lawsuits, Lane said: “There’s a lot of FUD out there, a lot of misinformation, but we are a regulated financial institution operating in this space for nine years, so we obviously take our responsibility very seriously.”\nSilvergate’s shares were already drifting lower prior to the FTX debacle, thanks to lower-than-expected Q3 earnings and the delay of the now-scrapped Stablecoin project.\nAD\nAD"}, {"date": "2023-01-05 14:30:00", "entity": ["thundercore", "thundercore", "defi", "thundercore", "curve finance", "aave", "sushiswap", "stargate", "thundercore", "defi", "thundercore", "validators", "thundercore", "defi", "defi", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundergene", "thundercore", "thundergene", "bitcoin", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundercore", "defi", "gamefi", "metaverse", "thundercore", "thundercore", "token", "tt", "silicon valley tech", "ethereum", "thundercore", "validator", "huobi", "thundercore", "huobi", "huobi", "earn", "tt", "mycointain mycointain btc", "usdt", "fiat", "thundercore", "thundercore", "defi", "thundercore", "defi", "tt", "886 studios", "outliers fund", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundercore", "thundercore", "decentralized finance", "defi", "thundercore", "huobi", "mycointainer", "thundercore"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Top 5 blockchain ThunderCore is making an ecosystem-development push, partnering with a host of new validators as the chain rolls out its new cryptocurrency staking model. At the same time, ThunderCore is leveraging these promising developments to expand its presence in decentralized finance (DeFi), making overtures to leading protocols.\nThe newest ThunderCore validators include the famous virtual asset exchange Huobi and one of the earliest staking platforms in the space, MyCointainer. Users of both will now be able to stake ThunderCore’s native asset TT to earn rewards.\nUnlike proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin, ThunderCore is an environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) chain, which means that its consensus mechanism for validating transactions is based on incentivized crypto staking.\nThunderCore’s new PoS staking model, also known as ThunderCore 2.0, will dramatically increase both user staking and validator nodes. Such decentralization is crucial to secure PoSchains like ThunderCore, which must withstand coordinated attacks by malicious actors seeking to control two-thirds of the network, while adding more trustworthy validators also improves scalability and accelerates user growth.\nValidator expansion\nAs a new partner, Huobi will implement and maintain a ThunderCore node, further securing the ThunderCore ecosystem. Additionally, Huobi's tens of millions of users will have access to ThunderCore PoS staking, while TT will be available to stake on Huobi Earn.\nOn top of operating a node, MyCointainer will allow for deposits and withdrawals on the platform. MyCointainer users will have access to TT trading pairs against BTC, USDT, and other major cryptos and fiat pairs.\nThe expansion of the validator network represents a significant step forward for ThunderCore, solidifying its position as a leading blockchain.\nDeFi outreach\nWith the new ThunderCore 2.0 PoS staking model, the popular blockchain has overhauled its tokenomics, aiming to become an even bigger DeFi player in the years to come. Having already nurtured its native DeFi ecosystem, the ThunderCore developers are now seeking to court top DeFi protocols such as Curve Finance, AAVE, SushiSwap, Stargate and many others.\nThe ThunderCore team has begun this effort with making approaches to the leading DeFi projects. Here’s one proposal from the developers presenting their case as to why the protocol should deploy on ThunderCore. Diversifying ThunderCore’s native DeFi ecosystem allows the team to build a brighter future with the support of the project’s multi-chain feature, decentralization, and community-driven economics.\nThe team offers ThunderCore's user-retention and mass-adoption strategy (over 400K monthly active users), one-stop-shop TT Wallet, high levels of interoperability, extensive partnerships, and range of developer incentives and tools, among other points.\nCorresponding proposals are in the works for the other major DeFi protocols.\nFuture expectations\nThunderCore will continue to welcome new validators to its PoS network. This aligns with the team’s commitment to providing a secure and decentralized platform for its users. Adding new, reputable organizations to the validator network enhances the security of the blockchain, making it a top choice for decentralized applications. Meanwhile, increased staking rewards under the new tokenomics are a tangible benefit to the community that furthers the same goals.\nThunderCore will also be encouraging more DeFi projects to open up shop. The high-performance chain offers many benefits for DeFi, including sub-second transactions, gas fees at a fraction of a cent, and massive scalability. These features make ThunderCore an ideal home for DeFi developers looking to build and grow on a reliable and secure network.\nThunderCore for developers\nThunderCore is among the most hospitable homes for developers in the Web3 industry. The company has long believed that if you attract the best developers, then the users will follow. To that end, they have made various efforts to nurture their developer community:\nThunderGene API Tool\nThunderCore’s groundbreaking API tool allows for the easy integration of Web3 features into Web2 apps. With ThunderGene, it’s possible to create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and fungible tokens inside a Web2 app while outsourcing the burden of wallet security to the cutting-edge TT Wallet.\n$100M Web3 Fund\nAlong with partners 886 Studios and Outliers Fund, ThunderCore maintains a $100M fund to assist those who would like to build decentralized applications on its chain.\nDeveloper Growth Fund\nIn addition to the $100M Web3 Fund, ThunderCore also operates a Developer Growth Fund, which is about to undergo a major update. The fund guides projects to completion with technical, promotional, financial, and operational assistance.\nStay tuned over at the ThunderCore blog for the latest on the fund and other news.\nAbout ThunderCore\nThunderCore is among the world’s top 5 blockchains and the only platform growing DApp users organically through ecosystem retention, which will be the key driving force behind the real mass adoption of blockchain. Its proof-of-stake (PoS) architecture, EVM compatibility, entertainment-first ethos, and deep developer support provide a battle-tested home for the next generation of crypto innovators across Web3, DeFi, NFTs, GameFi, and the metaverse.\nThanks to its unique PaLa consensus mechanism, ThunderCore can handle 4,000+ TPS with sub-second confirmation times and ultra-low gas fees kept at a fraction of a cent.\nThunderCore Token (TT), the chain’s popular native asset, can be stored in the feature-rich TT Wallet, together with other supported ecosystem assets.\nCreated in 2017 by Silicon Valley tech entrepreneur Chris Wang to help solve Ethereum’s scalability issues, ThunderCore was able to reach such an achievement in ecosystem retention because of the proven, stable, scalable, and secure blockchain technology built over the last five years.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Flash loans, fixed-term deposits, yield optimization strategies, and more — the Defi space offers an array of options for you to take advantage of.\nAs a decentralized project, Aave (AAVE) uses an automated market maker (AMM) tomanage liquidity and pricing. There is also a governance system in place, which allows AAVE holders to make decisions about the project.\nWhile Aave (AAVE) is leading the way in Defi, the bear market has caused the token to drop by more than 90% since hitting an all-time high of $666 in 2021. Aave (AAVE) still has a future, but holders are getting impatient, especially with the likes of OrbeonProtocol (ORBN) growing so well.\nHex Coin (HEX)\nFounded by Richard Hart, Hex Coin (HEX) is a decentralized savings platform that rewards users for holding their tokens. Hex Coin offers high returns over time, with the potential to earn an annual return of over 100% p.a.\nHex Coin is powered by Ethereum smart contracts and utilizes a hybrid PoW + PoSconsensus mechanism, allowing users to earn rewards when they stake Hex Coin tokens to secure the network.\nHowever, while Hex Coin (HEX) saw impressive gains during the 2021 bull run, the Hex Coin price has since retraced and is currently trading down 96% since last November. While the bear market can take a lot of the blame, Hex Coin (HEX) is under fire for being a “scam” project and failing to deliver on its promises.\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN)\nBy introducing blockchain technology to the venture capital industry, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is revolutionizing the investing landscape and disrupting traditional venture capital models.\nOn Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), startups can access the funding they need by minting their equity as fractionalized NFTs. Investors can then purchase these NFTs for as low as $1, reducing the amount of risk and providing more liquidity to venture capital investments.\nNo longer do startups have to contend with strict venture capital requirements or expensive financing options. With Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), startups can access funding from a larger pool of investors, and investors have the opportunity to diversify their portfolios.\nThe Orbeon platform utilizes its own digital asset, the ORBN token, to reward platform users. By staking their ORBN tokens, token holders can earn a share of the fees generated on the platform, and holding the token allows users to gain access to exclusive investment opportunities, and governance rights.\nGiven how quickly news of Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is spreading, it’s no surprise that phases 1 and 2 of the presale have sold out quickly and seen a price increase from $0.0004 to $0.0362. Phase 3 looks to be no different, as analysts forecast ORBN will rise by a total of 6000% by the time it hits exchanges.\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\nTelegram: https://t.me/OrbeonProtocol\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

He accuses unbacked crypto assets of having no intrinsic value and says that they are primarily used for speculative purposes rather than payments or funding consumption or investment. Instead, he maintains that they may, however, continue to be a vehicle for gambling in the digital era.\nHe says that the cost to society of an unregulated crypto industry is too high to ignore. In addition to causing significant losses for investors, unregulated crypto assets can be used for tax evasion, money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctions evasion.\nHe believes that they also have a high environmental cost, and states that it is therefore crucial that regulatory gaps are addressed and the social costs of cryptos are addressed.\nPanneta thinks that the EU's Regulation on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) is a step in the right direction, but that more needs to be done to ensure that all segments of the industry are regulated, including decentralised finance activities such as crypto asset lending or non-custodial wallet services.\nCrypto is gambling\nHe is of the view that unbacked crypto assets should be treated as gambling activities and regulated accordingly, with vulnerable consumers protected through principles similar to those recommended by the European Commission for online gambling.\nHe sees that global regulation is also necessary to prevent regulatory arbitrage and ensure that the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee for the treatment of banks' exposures to crypto assets are implemented.\nOpinion\nFabio Panneta is an ardent opponent of cryptocurrencies and even though he maintains that they have not yet impacted on the traditional financial system, he is likely of the belief that they could eventually be rival forms of currency.\nPublishing a blog that accuses the crypto sector of being a place for gamblers is not helpful. It belittles the truly innovative technologies that have come out of the industry and is aimed at scaring retail investors away.\nIf trading in cryptocurrencies is gambling, then trading in stocks, bonds, and all the other traditional financial assets must also be so.

In an article by analyst Vetle Lunde, the firm warns:\nInvestors should pay attention to the ongoing financial distress related to Digital Currency Group (DCG) as the outcome could severely impact crypto markets.\nIn the reasoning behind the warning, Arcane Research states that if DCG goes bankrupt, it could be forced to liquidate its assets. “This could force DCG into selling its sizable positions in GBTC and unknown positions in ETHE and other Grayscale trusts,” Lunde said.\nFurther, the analyst argues that a “natural, less liquidity-constrained” solution could be a Reg M solution that allows holders of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH), and the other trusts to redeem shares at net asset value.\nThis would resolve the near-record NAV – the value by which the fund trades below the Bitcoin spot price. GBTC was trading at -45.35% yesterday, while ETH was at a NAV of -55.83%. Dissolution of the trust via Reg M would trigger tangible impacts on crypto markets, as GBTC comprises about 3.3% of the circulating BTC supply and 2.5% of the ETH supply.\nArcane describes the threat to the market in the massive arbitrage opportunities:\nA Reg M would cause a massive arbitrage strategy of selling crypto spot versus buying Grayscale Trust shares. If this scenario plays out, crypto markets could face further downside.\nIn the long run, however, Arcane Research calls this scenario a positive event, as the crypto market is “finally relieved of the huge burden” caused by the “Grayscale widowmaker trade.” According to Lunde, this could even be the potential final market bottom event.\nBitcoin Facing Final Intrinsic Shock?\nAs NewsBTC BTC reported, the pressure on DCG is growing day by day. Earlier this week, Gemini founder Cameron Winklevoss published an open letter claiming that Barry Silbert’s DCG was using stalling tactics in bad faith. Winklevoss gave Silbert a deadline of January 8 to return the $900 million in Gemini Earn client funds.\nIf Silbert does not comply, this could culminate in the coordination of a voluntary DCG Chapter 11 filing, according to Arcane Research. In addition, Valkyrie Investments and $3.5 billion asset manager Fir Tree also took the stage.\nValkyrie made an offer to become the new sponsor and manager of GBTC while announcing the launch of an opportunistic fund to take advantage of GBTC discounts. Fir Tree has filed a lawsuit, presumably in a tactical move to hurt DCG’s valuation and reduce the likelihood of investment by third parties.\nAt press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $16,817, still lacking volatility.\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-05 13:26:00", "entity": ["twitter shib", "telegram channel", "shib", "’", "u.", "twitter", "shibarium", "shibarium", "shib", "bone token", "shib discord", "##ium shibbpp", "shib discord", "shibarium", "shib army", "shytoshi", "shibarium", "shibarium", "##ium shib", "ethereum", "ethereum chain", "unification fund", "shytoshi", "shibarium", "kusama", "shib", "shib tok unification fund", "toitsu", "shib", "bone tokens"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

Quick and easy payments, innovative financial services, and inclusivity to previously unbanked regions in the world are all made possible by the crypto ecosystem.\nBut with these opportunities come challenges and risks. Many crypto platforms lack strong operational, governance, and risk practices. These problems have emerged with huge ramifications in 2022 with the collapse of Terra Luna — one of the biggest stablecoins — and FTX — the second biggest exchange that filed for bankruptcy.\nBeyond these collapses, there are also several high-profile cases of hacking-related theft of customer funds on centralized and DeFi platforms. These problems have reinforced the debate about the importance of private keys.\nWe recently caught up with Georgios Kalmpazidis, co-founder and CEO of Swaps.app, who shared his thoughts on the topic.\nQ — What do you think about the current security problems plaguing the blockchain industry?\nTalking about blockchains, maybe this is the most transparent, secure and democratic technology and system humanity has ever created. It’s getting increasingly popular over the years, and today besides crypto, it is widely used in many other fields, such as health care, property, smart contract, etc.\nBlockchain is a relatively new technology that currently meets several security challenges, but I would like to look at those challenges from two perspectives – blockchain and users. From the blockchain perspective, most vulnerabilities are related to the sybil, 51% and routing attacks, which are common issues, are successfully taken care of by cyber security professionals.\nRegarding the user side, the main challenges are phishing attacks and the security of private keys, which are some of the top issues. When we look deeper, the problems here are similar to the ones in traditional financing, and consistently guiding and educating the users is the key to protecting their funds and fighting fraudsters. It should be one of the top priorities for the companies.\nAbove all the mentioned factors, there is another major problem, which is the biggest roadblocker for the industry’s organic development. I call it an irresponsible and immature business strategy, which misleads and mistreats the users bringing them enormous losses. Unfortunately, we have several similar cases in the industry that we all can recall.\nQ — Do you think the collapse of major crypto platforms threatens crypto adoption?\nThe drop in market capitalization and what happened with some of the major crypto platforms during 2022 led to a sense of uncertainty regarding the crypto adoption rate. Past events have eroded trust in the industry and affected the market, raising the urgency over keeping private keys independently and securely.\nAt Swaps.app we are optimistic that the industry will survive after all those collapses. Definitely, the pace would be different, but through more comprehensive regulation, the industry will become much healthier, more trustworthy and more consistent.\nQ — How important is it for users to hold their private keys?\nAs I mentioned earlier, the security of private keys remains one of the top issues, especially amid the current market situation. It’s the main key to the users’ funds and should be owned and kept by them. Of course, it also depends on the users’ needs and trading behaviour. Many crypto platforms offer custodial wallet services that offer high-level security and protection of the wallet and are convenient for those who actively trade crypto. In this case, users must be picky when choosing between public custodial wallets. Nevertheless, we advise always keeping most of your funds on your private key.\nQ —- How can crypto users best protect their private keys from being guessed or hacked?\nWhen protecting private keys, I always compare it with the situation when we lock the front door after leaving home. We never keep it open or leave the key on the lock. It’s the same with the private keys. If it is weak or unprotected, your funds are at risk.\nThe first step, maybe a trivial one, for users to protect their private keys is to keep their credentials private from others. I call it trivial because it sounds basic, but in most cases, users mistakenly share it with hackers during phishing attacks.\nAlso, it’s vital to use keep the two-factor authentication on, avoid simple combinations of passwords, don’t save your password in the browsers, regularly clear the cookies and caches of your browser, and save your credential in a safe way where no one, even a close friend or a family member, has access, use malicious link detection software or apps, improve device security with antivirus software, keep the device system and browser up to date, avoid connecting to the open or public WiFi networks.\nWe constantly remind our users of these simple rules and encourage them to keep their personal information and credentials safe when they buy crypto at Swaps.app.\nQ —- What are the security features that crypto platforms need to incorporate to prevent high-profile hacks and scams\nSecurity is the cornerstone of the crypto industry, and while platforms compete over price, rates, speed and other important parameters, security wins the competition. After it comes the rest.\nA cryptocurrency system requires secure creation of cryptographic keys and seeds. Companies shoul examine their organization’s security measures in this area, paying close attention to confidentiality and unguessable numbers.\nMaintaining cryptocurrency wallet/key usage integrity is also critical. Risks such as lost or stolen keys or unintentional disclosure of the wallet holder’s identity can be avoided with best practices such as key storage and more firm ongoing assessments.\nQ —- What do you think will be the biggest trend in blockchain for the next 12 months?\nThere are many blockchain trends to look out for in 2023, but the biggest one for me is the wide usage of CBDCs, as more governments will introduce their digital assets. At Swaps.app, we look forward to supporting CBDCs for users and business partners whenever they are public. The rising investment in stablecoins and more interest towards DeFi will be blockchain trends, too, during the next 12 months.\nQ —- What has been the toughest challenge you’ve faced in our industry so far?\nHigh velocity and trust issues in the industry were our toughest challenges. I can proudly notice that due to the consistent improvements and updates Swaps.app succeeds in providing high-quality and seamless crypto purchases for customers and quick and secure crypto and fiat payment processing for online businesses.\nAlso, we are very careful and selective about choosing liquidity, fraud-prevention and payment partners, making us a secure crypto platform. During the last 12 months, we’ve finished our integration with industry-leading companies, including TrueLayer, Stripe, Sumsup, and Binance, updated our services, and introduced new coins and features, making a big leap to the next chapter of the company’s history.\nSwaps.app is a fully compliant and regulated European crypto company which effectively combines industry-leading security with a blazingly fast and incredibly easy-to-use platform to bring buying and selling crypto to everyone, beginner or expert, company or individual.\nImage: Swaps.app blog"}, {"date": "2023-01-05 13:00:17", "entity": ["aag", "metaone wallet", "aag", "metaone wallet", "metaone wallet", "metaone wallet", "metaone dap", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag", "metaone wallet", "metaone", "simplex", "coinbase", "pay", "metaone", "sg", "aag", "metaone [UNK] wallet", "metaverse economy", "metaone wallet", "coinbase pay", "simplex", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag academy", "metaone", "metaone", "web3", "metaone", "metaone wallet", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "polygon", "harmony", "bnb"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Singapore, SG, 5th January, 2023, Chainwire\nWeb3 infrastructure company AAG has officially launched its flagship product - the MetaOne ® Wallet .

He stated that based on his earlier reporting, the SEC decided that Ripple was flouting its authority because the crypto company continued to sell XRP tokens despite warnings to stop from the SEC. \"The way it was being sold seemed to establish #XRPs designation as a security,\" Gasparino explained.\nHe also mentioned the case of Ethereum which, just as Bitcoin, was classified as a commodity, stating, \"Ethereum did possibly one sale and stopped.

The team added, “No other tokens will be necessary to operate within the protocol.”\nIn addition, the Shibarium team also made clear the ownership and objective of the blockchain, noting that Shibarium is built only for the Shiba Inu community and ecosystem to innovate while involving SHIB and not for any other projects outside the network.\n“Shibarium has been developed for Shib token and not for the sake of other projects who claim ownership or speculation surrounding its operability dependency on any other tokens,” the team stated using the Shibarium official account.\nShiba Inu’s Shibarium Beta Launch Draws Near\nWith the constant anticipation of the Shibarium blockchain launch, prominent developers like Shytoshi Kusama and Trophias in the past weeks have dropped several hints indicating that the launch of the beta version of the Layer 2 blockchain is very close.\nThough some community members speculate that the development of Shibarium has been completed and is just waiting for the right time to deploy, they have expressed frustration at the prolonged delay of the network.\nInitially, the Shibarium blockchain launch was set for September 2022. However, the developers eventually confirmed that there was a technical issue which has now resulted in the delay of the network. Even with hints and the hopes of its coming soon being given, there is still no official launch date yet.\nNotably, the Shibarium community Discord admin recently introduced a “Shibarium announcement” section in the Shiba Inu discord. Multiple SHIB developers and influencers have been seen sharing the update from the official Twitter handle.\nSHIB and BONE Recent Price Action\nSo far, SHIB has seen a reasonable momentum to the upside, following the path of other altcoins. As of the time of writing, Shiba Inu’s price is currently trading at $0.00000860, up over 4% in the last 24 hours. With a trading volume of $203 million.\nIn contrast, Bone has also gained upward momentum, and as of the time of writing, BONE is also currently trading at $1.08, up over 14% in the last 24 hours, with a trading volume of $9.9 million.\nFeatured image from Ferhat Deniz Fors on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-05 10:00:12", "entity": ["bitcoin", "macro", "fed", "wall street journal", "fomc", "fed", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "goldman sachs", "fed", "yahoo! sports", "tradingview. com", "fomc", "fed", "fed", "fed", "central bank", "fomc", "cpi", "bitcoin", "fed", "bitcoin", "fed", "fomc", "fed"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Bitcoin price has responded to yesterday’s release of the FOMC Minutes with a brief bounce to $16,990, only to revert back to the previous range of around $16,800 shortly after, within 30 minutes. And this trend could continue in the weeks and months ahead. Macro analyst Alex Kruger stated:\nWelcome to the 2023 Pump and Whack ranging market. Markets pump on falling inflation, and the Fed whacks it.\nThe analyst based his opinion on a series of tweets from the chief economics correspondent at The Wall Street Journal, Nick Timiraos. The renowned journalist said that one of the key statements in the meeting minutes is that Fed officials are concerned that an “unwarranted easing of financial conditions” could “complicate” their fight against inflation.\nThat’s probably one reason why the FOMC minutes contain almost no discussion of how much officials plan to raise interest rates at the February meeting. Instead, the minutes state that officials continue to face a difficult communication task and want to avoid broad “unwarranted” easing of financial conditions.\nWhile investors see a faster decline in inflation and respond with relief rallies, the Fed could in turn squelch that euphoria. If the CPI data turns out much better than estimates, the phenomenon of December 13 and 14, when the CPI data and the FOMC meeting occurred in quick succession, could be repeated.\nIn the run-up to and after the release of the CPI data, the Bitcoin price rose by almost 10% to $18,350, only to be brought back down to earth by the Fed’s hawkish statements. Bitcoin subsequently fell 12% to $16,280.\nThis “pump and whack” trading could continue in January and February as numerous experts predict another significant drop in inflation. CPI data for December 2022 will be released on January 12, 2023, at 8:30 am EST. Thus, positive numbers could cause a rally, but with a tight expiration date.\nThe next FOMC meeting will be held from January 31 to February 01. The subsequent press conference will then take place as usual at 2:00 pm EST on the second day. That’s when the Fed’s hawkish hammer could strike, bringing down the Bitcoin price again.\nAt press time, the Bitcoin price was at $16,793, stuck in a tight range from $16,250-$17,000 till December 17.\nBitcoin Price In The Run-Up To The Next FOMC Meeting\nThe meeting minutes also show that Fed officials agreed that the Fed needs to slow the pace of its aggressive rate hikes (50 bps in December). At the same time, it noted that “most participants emphasized the need to retain flexibility and optionality when moving policy to a more restrictive stance.”\nThis could suggest that Fed officials might be willing to return to a quarter percentage point increase at the next meeting, but also that they remain open to an even higher than expected final rate if high inflation persists.\nThe minutes also show that relatively few concerns were expressed at the December meeting that the central bank might go too far at this point and trigger a recession. Only some participants acknowledged that the risks to the inflation outlook must have become more balanced, meaning that the risk of doing too little was no longer much greater than the risk of doing too much.\nIn response, Goldman Sachs commented that the “Fed either pivots too early and turns dovish into a high inflation scenario which is fairly bearish the USD thus helping gold or they pivot too late and cause a much bigger recession than is priced in right now, resulting flight to safety helps gold.”\nFeatured image from Yahoo!

At the same time, it is being actively promoted by various Solana-based projects and even official blockchain accounts.\nLike Shiba Inu, BONK has a monstrously huge token supply of 99.185 trillion. As with SHIB, the Bonk Inu token is proposed to be burned, thereby reducing the number of zeros after the decimal point in its price.\nTo date, 815 billion BONKs have been burned, more than half of which were destined for Solana's most popular NFT collection, the DeGods team. However, as U.Today wrote, the DeGods team moved to other blockchains after failing to reach an agreement with Solana, and the Bonk Inu team responded by burning their BONKs."}, {"date": "2023-01-05 09:22:00", "entity": ["near", "near", "near protocol", "near", "near foundation", "protocol", "coin"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

Gasparino raised the question of why the SEC focused on Ripple while it let Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX have their way.\nAccording to the journalist, there are two legitimate reasons why Ripple has become the SEC’s target. On the one hand, the SEC believes that “Ripple management flouted the rules.” On the other hand, Ripple has undermined the SEC’s authority by continuing to sell XRP after being asked to stop it.\nGasparino said the way XRP was sold established its designation as a security. Further, he stated that Ethereum “did possibly one sale and stopped. No case. Not picking sides; just reporting why case was brought.”\nRipple’s General Counsel (GC), Stuart Alderoty did not let the allegation go unrebutted, firing off a renewed counterattack against the SEC, which he says is working out deals behind closed doors:\nEven if true, this only shows that the SEC’s unelected bureaucrats believe they have unchecked power to issue indiscriminate closed door edicts under pain of punishment to those who don’t blindly obey. We have crossed from regulation by enforcement to hubris most foul.\nNew Filings In Ripple Vs. SEC Case\nMeanwhile, some new impetus has been added to the Ripple case against the SEC. As Bitcoinist reported, all non-parties had to file their motions to seal by yesterday, January 4. And Judge Torres has received quite a few briefs.\nA filer for a cryptocurrency exchange has filed a motion to seal portions of the parties’ summary judgment documents to redact references that identify the exchange or its employees or provide contact information.\n“Third Party A” is filing a motion to redact information in the summary judgment that relates to confidential business information of the party and the privacy interests of its current and former employees.\n“Investor A” requests the sealing or partial redaction of seven documents containing research and investment analysis and investor identifying information. In addition, “Non-Party D” has filed a motion to redact portions of certain exhibits attached to the SEC’s motion for summary judgment.\nA non-party designated as an “investment banker declarant” who filed a declaration to facilitate the SEC’s investigation of Ripple has filed a motion to redact his declaration in support of the SEC’s motion for summary judgment.\nLast but not least, former Ripple partner MoneyGram, which has put its cooperation on hold following the SEC’s action, has filed a motion to seal certain portions of the parties’ summary judgment documents.\nThe next deadline in the case is January 9, when the deadline to oppose the class motions to seal expires. A few days later, on January 13, both Ripple and the SEC must file the Daubert motions and related exhibits with redactions on the public docket.\nThe final date so far is January 18. On this date, Ripple and the SEC are required to file any objections to the non-parties motions.\nAt press time, the XRP price stood at $0.3450, seeing a slight price drop of 0.8% in the last 24 hours.\nFeatured image from Binance, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-05 07:40:00", "entity": ["coinbase", "ftx exchange", "coinbase", "coinbase", "coinbase", "coinbase", "new york", "department of financial services", "coinbase", "dfs", "coinbase", "coinbase", "coinbase", "coinbase", "coinbase", "coinbase management", "##base", "coinbase", "coinbase", "grayscale bitcoin trust", "coinbase", "coinbase", "coinbase", "new york", "department of financial services", "dfs", "coinbase", "coinbase", "coinbase", "new york department of financial services", "dfs", "coinbase"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Brian Armstrong-led cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has reached a $100 million settlement with New York’s Department of Financial Services (DFS), according to statements released by both parties.\nFollowing the news, the Coinbase stock saw a considerable jump, rising over 12%.\nCoinbase Settles New York State Investigation\nCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has announced that it has reached a $100 million settlement with the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS). The exchange and the regulator announced the news through separate statements released on Wednesday. Under the terms of the settlement, Coinbase will pay a $50 million fine, and invest a further $50 million towards compliance efforts, and look to block any potential criminal or malicious actor from using the exchange. Coinbase will also be required to work with a third-party monitor.\n“This agreement includes a $50 million penalty and a separate commitment from Coinbase to invest $50 million in our compliance program over two years.”\nClose Scrutiny Of Coinbase\nAccording to regulators from New York’s Department of Financial Services, Coinbase had long-standing failures in its anti-money laundering program. The DFS also found that Coinbase treated its onboarding requirements for customers as a simple “check-the-box” and had not carried out sufficient background checks on its users. In a statement, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, stated that the firm had taken substantial measures to address “historical shortcomings.”\nThe enforcement action by authorities comes as state and federal regulators have ramped up their efforts following the spectacular collapse of the Sam Bankman-Fried-led FTX exchange, which was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world.\nSignificant Compliance Shortcomings\nAccording to regulators, shortcomings in Coinbase’s compliance processes led to considerable suspicious and unlawful conduct facilitated through the platform. Regulators cited a case where one Coinbase customer was charged with crimes related to child sexual abuse but was not flagged by the Coinbase system when they joined the platform. Regulators added that the user in question could access the exchange and engage in “suspicious transactions potentially associated with illicit activity without detection.”\nCoinbase eventually identified the user, closed the account, and reported the user to law enforcement authorities. On its part, Coinbase has committed to identifying and rectifying issues that regulators have flagged. Furthermore, Coinbase management has consistently pushed for broader and clearer regulations of the crypto industry. In an op-ed, the Coinbase CEO wrote,\n“Despite the prevailing notion that crypto companies don’t want to be regulated, many — if not most — companies have been working with policymakers for years.”\nCoinbase Stock Jumps\nFollowing the settlement news, the Coinbase stock price jumped nearly 12%. The platform is the only publicly traded cryptocurrency exchange in the United States and had disclosed the probe in its 2021 10-K filing with the SEC. Additionally, several other major players, such as the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, rely on Coinbase for the custody of their assets in cold storage. Coinbase holds licenses across the United States and globally.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A buzzy start to the NFT market in 2022 buoyed the year-end tally and helped make up for the several weaker months that followed, the data suggests.\nThe NFT market generated around $24.7 billion worth of organic trading volume in 2022 across blockchain platforms and marketplaces, DappRadar shared with Decrypt. That’s a slight dip from the $25.1 billion total recorded in 2021 as the NFT market surged in activity and interest as tokenized collectibles first became more than a niche interest.\nAD\nAD\nDappRadar’s “organic” data excludes trades that are suspected to be wash trades, or trades that have been manipulated in some way.\nWash trading often occurs when traders sell their own NFTs back and forth between their controlled wallets at inflated prices, often in an attempt to game a token rewards model on a marketplace. Billions of dollars’ worth of wash trading was excluded from the data, as seen at marketplaces like LooksRare and X2Y2, which offered token incentives for trading.\nWhile overall trading volume for the year was largely flat, DappRadar recorded a major surge in the number of NFTs traded last year. The analytics firm recorded about 101 million NFT trades over the course of 2022, compared to about 58.6 million NFT trades in 2021. In other words, more NFTs were traded at lower USD values, given crumbling crypto and NFT prices.\nNFTs in 2022\nThe crypto market lost significant value over the course of the year, with losses accelerating in May amid the collapse of Terra’s LUNA and UST. The so-called crypto winter was then exacerbated by the downfall of crypto exchange FTX and the resulting industry contagion, impacting crypto prices further.\nThe NFT market followed a similar progression throughout the year. Sales surged in January as 2021’s momentum carried into the new year, as top marketplace OpenSea alone registered a record month with $5 billion in trading volume.\nTrading volume dipped in the months thereafter, but then the massive late April launch of NFT land plots for Yuga Labs’ Otherside—a Bored Ape Yacht Club-themed metaverse game—buoyed the market and drove OpenSea to a single-day record for trading volume. At that point, it looked as though 2022 NFT sales volume could handily top 2021’s tally.\nThat spike didn’t last, however. As crypto prices collapsed in May, so too did NFT trading momentum, with prices falling sharply as a result. Monthly volume fell from nearly $3.3 billion in May to just over $1 billion in June, per DappRadar, but the market hasn’t topped the $1 billion mark in the months since.\nEthereum’s Bored Ape Yacht Club was last year’s top-selling NFT project, according to data from CryptoSlam, with nearly $1.6 billion worth of trading volume. However, the vast majority of that trading took place between January and May, as starting prices fell from a late April peak of $429,000 worth of ETH to a recent low of under $60,000 in November.\nAD\nAD\nDecember data\nCompared to the early-year heights, the NFT market ended 2022 with a relative whimper. But overall trading volume ticked up slightly over November’s tally, while the number of NFTs sold in the final month of the year rebounded after a dip the previous month.\nAccording to DappRadar, the NFT market produced nearly $684 million worth of organic trades in December, up from an adjusted total of over $662 million in November. About 6.7 million NFTs were sold during the month, up from about 4.8 million in November and 6.1 million in October.\nOpenSea remained the leading marketplace for organic NFT trades, notching over $297 million worth in December, according to DappRadar. That’s up from about $259 million in November. Blur, a newer rival that has incentivized NFT trades with the promise of upcoming token rewards, jumped from about $115 million in November to almost $177 million in December.\nThe Solana blockchain continued its recent up-and-down pattern, falling to nearly $70 million from $95 million in November. It had previously dipped to $67 million in October after a hot September that saw nearly $134 million in NFT sales on the back of the launch of y00ts. The value of SOL fell sharply in November and December due to the FTX collapse.\nMeanwhile, Flow—the blockchain platform behind NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day—stemmed the bleeding after two straight months of 50% or greater declines. Flow posted about $6.8 million in NFT sales in December, down from about $7.7 million in November.\nAnd Top Shot saw its first small month-over-month gain after months of declines, up to $2.2 million in December (per CryptoSlam) after less than $2.1 million of NFT sales in November. The FLOW token set a new all-time low price earlier this week after steadily losing steam amid falling NFT activity on the platform."}, {"date": "2023-01-04 23:05:58", "entity": ["ether decentral park capital", "ethereum"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Ether (ETH): The second-largest cryptocurrency recently climbed 3.3% to trade around $1,252.

This coin, unlike its predecessors, is on the Solana blockchain and is now cementing itself as the most successful meme coin to come out of the ecosystem. The cryptocurrency has already grown rapidly over the last week, but is it still a good time to enter?\nShould You Buy BONK?\nLike with any meme coin, the price of BONK took off with excessive shilling on social media. This came from influencers with large followings and once the FOMO kicked in, the coin rapidly rose. Even now, it is still seeing a lot of interest with trading volume crossing $16 million in the last 24 hours.\nGiven this, it is possible that the meme coin has reached or is nearing its peak. With an over 2,000% increase already, buying now could leave late investors holding the bag once it begins its descent, especially in the current market climate with unfavorable conditions.\nHowever, on the flip side of this is the possibility that the coin is not done with its rally. It was the same way with other meme coins such as SHIB and DOGE, which had grown so much that it was thought they had reached their peak but they continued surging.\nThe only sure thing right now is that BONK will definitely get to a point where it is no longer able to sustain the hype. Once this happens, investors should expect to see such a decline trend as has been recorded in both DOGE and SHIB in the past year.\nIs Meme Coin Season Back?\nThe growth of BONK over the last couple of days could easily mislead one into believing that the meme coin season was returning but that is not the case. Besides, the Solana-based cryptocurrency, no other meme coins are rallying in the market currently.\nFor example, the largest meme coin in the market, Dogecoin, may be seeing some green right now but it is only seeing 1% gains in the last 24 hours. The same is the case for Shiba Inu which is only up 1.10% in the same time period.\nTo compare, BONK’s price is up over 110% in the last day alone, according to data from Coinmarketcap. If the cryptocurrency had triggered a return of the meme coin bull market, then there would be similar gains across other coins but the prices of these assets remain muted in the meantime.\nBONK is only 10 days old after being launched on December 25. The project is referred to as “The first Solana Dog Coin for the people, by the people,” and with a $107 million market cap as of Wednesday, it is officially the largest meme coin in the Solana ecosystem."}, {"date": "2023-01-04 22:53:52", "entity": ["twitter", "bit bitcoin", "twitter", "psa", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "trace meyer", "bit bitcoin", "twitter", "mastodon", "bitcoin", "dashjr", "dashjr", "dashjr", "twitter", "novak", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "decrypt", "ftx", "ftx"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "The winter holiday season might have just rolled to a close, but Bitcoin supporters had another curious tradition to carry out. Tuesday they celebrated a unique, annual, grassroots holiday known as \"Proof of Keys,\" started in 2019 by Bitcoin entrepreneur Trace Meyer.\nIn an experience that roughly mirrors a bank run, the community uses this day to encourage fellow Bitcoiners to pull their Bitcoin off of exchanges and other third-party services so that they can gain full ownership of their assets. The date was specifically chosen since it's the date of Bitcoin's \"genesis block,\" the first Bitcoin block ever mined, back in 2009.\nAD\nAD\nThe philosophy of the day is simple: Many people leave their Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) on exchanges. But by doing so, they're not taking full control of their funds. Instead, they’re trusting the exchange.\n\"Not your keys, not your coins,\" as the common refrain across the industry goes. (Or sometimes \"not your keys, not your cheese.\")\nAs the recent FTX calamity showed, third parties can't always be trusted. FTX lost billions of dollars of users’ cryptocurrency—and users of the exchange don't know if they'll ever get their money back.\n\"Everyone should take advantage of the most important Bitcoin property, the capacity of self-custody! [January] 3rd became a 'Bitcoin holiday' when we remember together this important effort,\" said Coinkite CEO and co-founder Rodolfo Novak in an email to Decrypt.\nHe added that \"self custody has become so easy, that no one has an excuse now,\" pointing to hardware wallets (like his company's COLDCARD), as a secure way to self-store funds without the need for an exchange or other third party.\nTo self-custody or not to self-custody\nA \"bank run\" conjures up the thought of the Great Depression, where many worried people lined up at their bank to withdraw their funds, concerned that their bank wasn't solvent.\nProof of Keys wasn't nearly as dramatic. But it's a similar idea. Browsing Twitter, a number of users claimed to have withdrawn their funds from exchanges or to have setup new hardware wallets to secure their coins.\nHardware startup Foundation, self-custody startup Casa, and others hosted Twitter Spaces throwing out tips on how to get started with self-custodying funds in the most secure manner. A key recommendation was to store funds on a hardware wallet disconnected from the internet so that it can’t be remotely hacked.\nAD\nAD\nBut most of the discussion revolved around what users shouldn’t do. Novak warned against storing seed phrases in the cloud. Unchained VP of Business Development Justine Harper said that “user error” and “overcomplicating things” were two of the main reasons she saw people lose funds via self-custody.\nFor example, a user might read something on Twitter about a more complicated self-custody mechanism, but it would be too complicated of a setup for them, the user would mess something up, and lose their money.\nSuch an example is a reminder of the risks of self-custodying funds. Namely, losing the Bitcoin keys (which essentially function as a password) means losing the Bitcoin, forever. Just before the Proof of Keys \"holiday,\" veteran Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr reported on Twitter that he lost millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin in a hack.\nPSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help please. #Bitcoin — @LukeDashjr@BitcoinHackers.org on Mastodon (@LukeDashjr) January 1, 2023\nSome argued that if a longstanding Bitcoin developer Dashjr can't even successfully self-custody his Bitcoin, then the average Joe has no hope.\nDashjr has yet to fully explain how he was securing his Bitcoin. But from what he has shared, Dashjr might not have had the best setup. His funds might have been in a hot wallet connected to the internet. This is discouraged by security experts across the industry.\nAs former Bitcoin Core contributor and maintainer Jonas Schnelli put it, \"Over-engineering and a paranoid-complexity-levels may lead to vulnerabilities. KISS your keys,\" invoking the acronym for \"Keep It Simple, Stupid.”\nIt goes to show the importance of using standard-wide best-practices of Bitcoin securely. For those who want to participate, Decrypt has a high-level guide explaining how to move funds to self-custody. In short, the industry standard has become storing funds on hardware wallets, since they are detached from the internet and can't be hacked remotely."}, {"date": "2023-01-04 22:38:05", "entity": ["stretto stablecoins", "celsius", "celsius", "celsius", "stablecoins", "celsius", "celsius network", "celsius", "stablecoins", "ad ad", "stablecoins", "celsius", "celsius", "celsius"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Digital assets deposited in Celsius Network’s Earn program belong to the bankrupt company’s estate and not individual users, according to a Wednesday ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn.\nThe court also determined that Celsius’ bankruptcy estate can sell $18 million worth of stablecoins—crypto assets that peg their price to another currency like the dollar—which were deposited in Earn accounts to fund administrative expenses.\nAD\nAD\n“Earn Assets in Earn Accounts constitute property of the Estates, and that the Debtors may sell stablecoins outside of the ordinary course of business,” Judge Glenn wrote in his ruling.\nUsers who participated in the bankrupt company’s lending service were told they could earn interest on cryptocurrencies deposited with the company, but lost access to their funds in June when Celsius froze withdrawals on its platform citing “extreme market conditions.”\nToday’s ruling will likely prevent those who took advantage of the service from receiving the full amount they deposited because they are considered unsecured creditors and “may recover only a small percentage of their claims” as a result.\nWhen Celsius entered bankruptcy in July, the company had approximately 600,000 interest-bearing accounts, according to a court document published by Celsius’ claims agent Stretto.\nA recent filing states the value of the company’s Earn accounts was approximately $4.2 billion shortly before it filed for bankruptcy.

The SEC said the company eventually laid off Morgenthau last year in August after discovering his run away with funds and vendors declining to work for the company.\nAccording to African Gold, it terminated Morgenthau at the time after knowing about his “improper withdrawals” endeavor to conceal them.

In a video published Tuesday, he vehemently denied most of the claims YouTuber Coffeezilla had made against his crypto game project, CryptoZoo, and said he intends to sue Coffeezilla, whose real name is Stephen Findeisen, for defamation.\nCryptoZoo is an online game on the Binance Smart Chain launched in 2021 where users buy “eggs” that hatch into hybrid animals. According to a company blog post, the animals could yield holders passive income in the form of the ZOO token.\nAD\nAD\nPaul previously said on an August 2021 episode of his podcast that CryptoZoo is “a really fun game that makes you money.” But that vision hasn’t exactly been realized.\nThe ZOO token has plummeted roughly 89% in the past year, according to PancakeSwap data. And Findeisen spoke with over six different people who claim to have lost thousands each from their CryptoZoo purchases. In total, just six of the individuals claim to have collectively lost nearly $600,000.\nThe CryptoZoo blog has not published a new post since April 2022, and neither its Instagram nor Twitter page have posted any new content since May 2022. Such a lack of activity could be interpreted as abandonment.\nThe CryptoZoo Twitter account did, however, suddenly retweet Paul’s Coffeezilla response video Tuesday—and Paul insists that CryptoZoo is not dead yet.\n“CryptoZoo is coming. I will make damn sure of it,” Paul said in his video.\nPaul denied that he ever scammed his fanbase through CryptoZoo and called Findeisen’s three-part series about the project “deeply unethical, dangerously misleading, and illegal.”\n“You led the charge to drive and monetize a narrative telling millions of people that I’m a fraud or I tried to scam my audience,” Paul said. “That is patently false.”\nPaul claimed that Findeisen actually knows Paul is innocent but was “twisting” facts and published the videos anyway. Paul argued that Findeisen “published a defamatory hit piece fully knowing I was innocent.”\nAD\nAD\nAttorney and Adjunct Professor of Law Andrew Rossow told Decrypt that because Paul is a public figure, he would need to prove “actual malice” or that Findeisen published the videos with a “reckless disregard for the truth” in order for a court to take Paul’s case seriously.\n“I think the biggest question that remains unanswered as of press time, which is at the heart of a potential defamation claim, is whether or not Paul’s ‘CryptoZoo’ was actually a ‘scam’—one that Paul intentionally created for the purposes of intentionally misleading and defrauding investors,” Rossow said.\nWhen it comes to whether Findeisen could be held liable in court, Rossow said that more information is needed on all of the steps Findeisen took toward “obtaining the truth” from Paul.\nLogan Paul responded.

Paul said Kelling only had three engineers.\n“I got everything stolen from me and our community,” Paul said of the CryptoZoo fiasco, claiming that he and his manager Jeffrey Levin have only lost money on CryptoZoo.\nPaul also claims that Findeisen’s published phone call interview with Levin was “illegal” and makes Findeisen “like an internet criminal” because he had not been granted permission to publicize the call.\nNeither Paul nor Levin have responded to Decrypt’s requests for comment.\nAD\nAD\nBut Paul did spend some time addressing the controversy on the latest episode of his Impaulsive podcast Wednesday.\n“The guy is good,” Paul said of the Coffeezilla CryptoZoo videos. “He is a very good storyteller and he is very, very manipulative.”\nRegardless, Paul intends to take legal action against Findeisen for the trio of Coffeezilla YouTube videos.\n“I suggest you use the money you got from pumping your Patreon to hire a good lawyer—you’re gonna need it,” Paul said in his Tuesday response video. “I’ll see you in court.”\nIn a message to Decrypt, Findeisen said he has not yet received any legal action from Paul’s team.\n“The fact Logan is suing me instead of the criminals and con-men he hired says it all,” Findeisen told Decrypt via direct message. “He took zero accountability.

HGE described the issue as a “massive exploit,” and called on Magic Eden to temporarily shut down the marketplace until the issue is completely resolved.\n“I know volume is important, but limit the damage first,” HGE tweeted at Magic Eden. “Make sure the exploit is stopped, like really make sure of it.”\nShortly after 1pm ET, Magic Eden tweeted that the issue had been resolved on its end, but that users may still see the fraudulent listings until they “hard refresh” their browsers.\nUpdate: Please hard refresh your browsers to make sure you are only seeing verified collection items. We're monitoring the situation & will use this thread for updates. We have fixed 2 issues:\n1) fake NFTs being listed on collection pages\n2) tx of fake NFTs on activity tabs — Magic Eden 🪄 (@MagicEden) January 4, 2023\n“Earlier today, we resolved the root issue but believe users who didn't hard refresh their browsers still saw unverified NFTs on collection & activity pages,” Magic Eden tweeted. “This is likely a situation that has impacted fewer than 10 collections. We will do a public postmortem [with] more details.” The company did not explain how the exploit happened and did not immediately respond to Decrypt's request for comment.\nOn Tuesday, Magic Eden similarly asked users to \"hard refresh\" their browsers after some saw pornographic images and stills from the TV show \"The Big Bang Theory\" in place of NFTs. Magic Eden blamed a hacked third-party image caching partner for the problem, and said that it was fixed.\nAD\nAD\nOn Thursday, a Magic Eden representative said that the issue affected just 13 NFTs sold across five collections, spanning a total of 27 transactions valued at around 1,100 SOL in total—just under $15,000 as of this writing. Previously, the firm claimed that the exploit spanned 25 NFTs sold across four collections in the 24 hours prior to the fix.\nMagic Eden said that it will refund users that inadvertently purchased a fake NFT from one of its verified projects. The company blamed the exploit on a user interface (UI) issue that emerged amid the launch of two recent features, its Snappy Marketplace and Pro Trade tools.\n\"The technical explanation is that our activity indexer for these two tools did not check that the creator address is verified,\" the firm wrote. \"Magic Eden’s smart contract remains secure, and this incident was an isolated UI issue.\"\nHGE told Decrypt that he believes that this is an exploit that has been active for some time, potentially for months, but that it hadn’t been used at a high level until now. Twitter user Christopher Moltistonki alleged that an exploit script is being sold on black market websites to potential scammers, and that such actions have elevated the visibility of the exploit.\nMagic Eden said that it will investigate further to see if there were additional past instances of fraudulent NFTs. A representative also confirmed to Decrypt that there were additional unverified NFTs listed on the platform that were not sold, but they can no longer be purchased due to the fixes.\nMetaplex, the creator of the Solana token standard that defines the functionality of NFTs, tweeted that the issue is unrelated to the Metaplex protocol or NFT standard.\n“This issue appears to be unrelated and caused by improper checks at the marketplace layer,” Metaplex tweeted, suggesting that it’s unrelated to a previous Metaplex bug that it said was resolved back in December.\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to include Magic Eden's latest statements and figures."}, {"date": "2023-01-04 18:09:08", "entity": ["bitcoin", "bitcoin", "australian securities and investment commission", "po street capital", "nguyen", "btc", "ethereum", "po street capital", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "po street capital", "arrows capital", "ftx", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Positive", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "Per public filings with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, a 25-year-old registered a million-dollar-worth trading company at his parents’ house.

However, there is no record of its current profits or trading activity.\nWith the Bitcoin and Ethereum price trending to the downside, an unfavorable macroeconomic condition, high inflation, and an overall downside trend in risk-on assets, PO Street Capital might have seen its profits dwindle.\nThese conditions have led to the downfall of major companies in the nascent sector.

The market had seen renewed interest following the holidays which led to a small recovery here and there especially for the large players but Solana had been able to break completely from the trend and record double-digit gains in the last couple of days.\nWhat Is Driving Solana’s Growth?\nDespite being at the forefront of massive FUD that has dragged its price down toward two-year lows, Solana has now been able to recover a good amount of gains over the last few days. While the comments from Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin in support of the blockchain had helped, there was another factor pushing the price higher.\nA new meme coin known as BONK had graced the Solana ecosystem and after being airdropped to holders of major NFT projects, the price of the meme coin had soared. The resulting gains would see investors FOMO into the cryptocurrency and since they needed to trade on the Solana network, the price of SOL had surged given all of the new attention it was receiving.\nIn two days, SOL ballooned to become one of the best performers in the space coming into the new year. It is up over 16% in the last 24 hours alone and the price of the digital asset has moved from the loss territory into the green over the last week. It is now sitting at almost 37% gains for investors over this time period, according to data from Coinmarketcap.\nCan SOL Hold The Gains?\nRight now, the growth of SOL in the market is still largely driven by the FOMO triggered by the BONK meme coin. Since the hype around this coin has been waxing strong, it is expected that interest will remain high among investors, thereby sustaining the growth trend recorded by Solana.\nHowever, it is important to keep in mind that the BONK cryptocurrency is largely driven by hype, and just like any other meme coin, it is expected that this hype would die down at some point. Now, once this happens, the decline in interest would also significantly impact the price of SOL, dragging it down along with it. That is unless something else comes up to drive the price of SOL higher.\nIt is also expected that some profit-taking would begin, where investors would begin to dump SOL to claim the gains already being seen. This, as well, will contribute to a wind-down, and a downward correction would follow. But this correction is not expected to claim more than 10% of current profits given that the price of SOL is now trading above its 20-day moving average of $12.3.\nSOL is changing hands at $13.72 at the time of this writing.

When Genesis Trading, which exists under the DCG umbrella, paused withdrawals, it had stranded over 340,000 Gemini Ear users. It is now more than a month since this happened and there has been no progress or word on when these customers would be able to withdraw their funds.\nIn the letter, Cameron told DCG that it had one week to return all of the money owed to his exchange. Apparently, the Gemini co-founder wants the company to return the complete $900 million so it can return it to customers. The founder told Silbert that he had until January 8 to return the funds.\nFor the past six weeks, we have done everything we can to engage you in a good faith and collaborative manner in order to reach a consensual resolution for you to pay back the $900 million that you owe, while helping you preserve your business. We appreciate that there are startup costs to any restructuring and at times things don’t go as fast as we would all like. However, it is now becoming clear that you have been engaging in bad faith stall tactics.\nThe letter also contained accusations towards the CEO over the way he had handled the issue so far. He alleged that Silbert had used the owed funds “to fuel greedy share buybacks, illiquid venture investments, and kamikaze Grayscale NAV trades.” Additionally, Cameron said that Silbert had done all of this for his own personal gain.\nWill Gemini Get The Money?\nAt this point, there are only about four days left in the ultimatum that Winklevoss gave to Silbert. The latter has already taken to Twitter to deny claims that DCG owes over $1.6 billion to Genesis. But there is no talk of if it will honor the ultimatum or not.\nThere you go again.

Through token approval sharing and management, the Permit2 smart contract grants applications with access to an array of secure authorization capabilities. On the other hand, Universal Router compile ERC-20 and NFT transactions into a single swap router, giving Uniswap a more efficient method for exchanging between various types of cryptocurrency.\nWith the introduction of these new smart contracts, Uniswap also announced a bug bounty program which would help the platform detect any potential vulnerabilities. As the digital currency and blockchain market continues to evolve, bug bounties have become a way for firms to ensure their software, systems, and critical infrastructure are secure.\nDeFi security auditing firm Dedaub was among the first to receive a hefty award for their work on identifying a vulnerability on the Universal Router smart contract. The vulnerability was flagged as having the ability to permit reentrancy during a transaction's confirmation time, which could be exploited by threat actors to then drain a wallet's funds.\nThe Dedaub team has disclosed a Critical vulnerability to the Uniswap team!\nFunds are safe - Uniswap addressed the issue and redeployed the Universal Router smart contracts on all its chains 👏\nThe vulnerability allows re-entertrancy to drain the user's funds, mid-tx.\n🧵 pic.twitter.com/wFSFsohPvy — Dedaub (@dedaub) January 2, 2023\nDedaub explains that the Universal Router provides users with the opportunity to make numerous transactions at once, such as exchanging multiple tokens and NFTs in a single go. The router's integrated scripting language is capable of a vast array of token activities including transfers to external payees. When done correctly step by step, these funds would be delivered right away should the transaction meet the criteria set by the smart contract's parameters.\nBy design, this means that a third-part code, when invoked during the transfer, could allow the code to re-enter the Universal Router and manage or pull tokens that are on the smart contract for a temporary period. This prompted the Dedaub whitehats to advise Uniswap of a resolution, which involved patching the smart contract with a reentrancy lock for the core execution module of Universal Router.\nUniswap then swiftly awarded $40,000 to the Dedaub team for their prompt disclosure. According to Uniswap, the issue was of medium-level severity, while further assessment of the vulnerability pointed to a low-chance, high-impact scenario. Dedaub confirms that the attack vector can be considered as user-end error, because the scenario would only happen if a user directly sends NFTs to an untrusted recipient.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, this effort fell short, as the campaign received a lukewarm response. In the end, the effort was able to galvanize a total of 6.27 ETH, which is around $8100. The donations will be returned to the donors with the campaign failing to achieve its target.\nThe Future For EmpireDAO\nWith EmpireDAO closing its current location, Fraietta stated that there are plans to reopen at another location for “Season 2.” He also highlighted plans for potential EmpireDAO pop-ups at various crypto conferences and at this year’s SXSW in Austin, Texas.

The financial regulator found issues with the company’s anti-money laundering controls dated “as far back as 2018,” the NYT said.\nAt that time, the crypto exchange committed to hiring an independent firm to fix the issues with its compliance program. The company set up an in-house system to keep track of suspicious activity, but the N.Y. regulator wanted more.\nAdrienne Harris, Superintendent of Financial Services for the state of New York, said:\nWe found failures that really warranted putting in place an independent monitor rather than wait for a settlement. We have been very outspoken about illicit financing concerns in the space. It is why our framework holds crypto companies to the same standard as for banks.\nThus, the NYDFS launched a formal investigation in 2021 using improper background checks and slow monitoring of suspicious activity as an excuse. In addition to the first independent monitor, Coinbase was ordered to hire a second independent company for its compliance program.\nPaul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, added the following:\nWe view this resolution as a critical step in our commitment to continuous improvement, our engagement with key regulators, and our push for greater compliance in the crypto space – for ourselves and others (…). Coinbase remains committed to being a leader and role model in the crypto space, and this means partnering with regulators when it comes to compliance and other areas.\nCoinbase Can Move On\nCoinbase and the New York Department of Financial Services will work together for at least another year, the NYT claims. The company has a backlog of over 100,000 “alerts” on potentially illegal or suspicious transactions.\nAccording to Grewal, the company has already made a “substantial investment” in its compliance program. These investments include building an on-chain analytics tool, Coinbase Tracer, and other solutions.\nThe crypto exchange is also monitoring every transaction on its platform with the Transaction Monitoring System (TMS). This tool allows it to “detect patterns suggestive of fraud, money laundering, or other illicit activity and flag them for further review.”\nThe crypto exchange also built the capacity to measure customer risk and applied more control to “high-risk customers” while complying with the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the Travel Rule. These solutions have been controversial, but Coinbase claims they protect their users’ “security and privacy.”\nGrewal highlighted the importance of their cooperation with regulators and the importance of concluding this investigation.

The mining company initiated this move by filing a revised proposed order on January 3, claiming that all Celsius mining rigs would be powered down immediately. The filing also stated that the powered-down rigs would not be restarted during the transition period.\nCelsius Defaulted On Electricity Fees\nThis move comes after several months of Celsius defaulting on power bills, for which Core Scientific even accused Celsius on October 21. In fact, the lack of payment had even created liquidity issues for the Bitcoin miner, for which it had to declare bankruptcy on December 21.\nAs a result, Core Scientific filed a motion on December 28 to reject the contract since Celsius had been in breach of contract due to non-payment of bills. The court filings have revealed that Core Scientific has covered around $7.8 million of power fees for Celsius till December 28 and claimed that it could not afford to continue shouldering the burden of Celsius’s unpaid power costs.\nBy terminating the Celsius contract, Core Scientific would be able to generate a revenue of $2 million per month by renting out the space currently occupied by the Celsius mining rigs.\nBTC Mining Not Profitable Anymore\nBitcoin mining is not a profitable expedition anymore. Costs of production have increased while Bitcoin prices have dropped. The Russia-Ukraine war has been a major factor leading to the rising costs of electricity, something that Bitcoin mining rigs need lots of. On top of that, the plummeting value of Bitcoin has also eaten into miners’ profits. In fact, Bitcoin’s hash price, which is the revenue miners can earn per unit of hash rate, has dropped by 75% in 2022.\nAs a result, share prices have also dropped, with Core Scientific itself losing almost 99.15% in its share prices throughout 2022. On the other hand, bankrupt crypto firm Celsius has already been ordered by a judge to refund customers' crypto assets worth $44 million. It is to be seen if Celsius returns any of the fees that it owes to the mining company.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The third reason, per Deaton, is that Ripple, the company that XRP is affiliated with, has been sued by the U.S. securities regular. The latter is calling XRP an \"unregistered security.\" All these reasons, Deaton believes, still support great interest of the crypto community in XRP.\nA token that was in Top 3 by market cap between 2015-2020, which has remained in the Top 10 after being called an unregistered security by the SEC, would suggest that people do. https://t.co/fud3ef7AOd — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 3, 2023\nRipple-SEC case about to finish?\nThe XRP army believes that Ripple will win against the SEC and looks forward to the settlement of the case that has been going on since the end of December 2020. Brad Garlinghouse, the chief executive, stated late last year that he expects the case to be settled in the first quarter of 2023. However, according to an earlier interview with him, one of the mandatory conditions for that would be regulatory clarity not only for Ripple and XRP but for the entire U.S. crypto industry if, of course, XRP is declared to be a nonsecurity asset.\nHe and other crypto influencers have many times rebuked the SEC and its chair Gary Gensler for a lack of clear rules to distinguish between tokens that are classified as securities and those that are not.\nMany in the crypto space who support XRP expect the price of the asset to skyrocket once Ripple wins the legal battle. Among them is founder of Gokhshtein Media David Gokhshtein, who has been quite supportive of XRP in the past couple of years since he was a U.S. congressional candidate.

He believes so since by now, according to his tweet, the amount of XRP locked by Ripple in escrow for future releases has dropped from 55 billion to 42.7 billion coins.

This constitutes a unique fundamental for OP tokens to see impressive highs this year.\nBuilding amid crypto winter\nBranded as the next frontier in blockchain-based and decentralized infrastructure, Optimism, as well as other Layer 2 protocols powered by rollup technology, is committed to continuous building despite the ongoing crypto winter.\nAs an infrastructure-based protocol, investors within the OP ecosystem are, as the name suggests, optimistic about the new milestones the token will break moving forward. Compared to the all-time high (ATH) of $4.57 it recorded about seven months ago, expectations are mounting regarding whether OP has enough of a technological and fundamental basis to retest new highs this year."}, {"date": "2023-01-04 14:45:00", "entity": ["williams", "williams", "eth", "ethereum", "nasdaq", "ycharts", "bitcoin", "gemini", "dcg", "gemini", "digital currency group", "ftx", "btc", "central bank", "fr consumer jibun bank", "jibun bank", "jibun bank", "jp", "ism", "xrp", "ultimate oscillator", "ultimate oscillator", "ltc", "litecoin", "cci", "cci", "ethereum", "btc", "ethereum", "bitcoin", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "In Todays Headline TV CryptoDaily News:\n2022 crypto attacks were least in December.\n\"Crypto market participants had few reasons to cheer in the last month of 2022 – with a low attack and theft figure among one of them.

The precious metal has seen a 15% rally in the past 60 days and keeps trending upwards.\nThe trading desk believes institutions are allocating into “alternative assets” or stores of value. The Bitcoin price is yet to benefit from this trend, but the crypto market is recording some profits. In particular, the non-fungible token space.\nThis sector is coming back to life after months of declining activity. Popular NFT collections experienced 2 to 3x profits in late 2022 and are likely to maintain the trend. QCP Capital noted Bitcoin and Ethereum’s price action:\n(…) in line with Gold and NFTs, BTC and ETH are playing catch up to some extent at the start of the year. Despite the mini rally, BTC is still trading in an extremely tight falling wedge – with 18k the key breakout level to the topside.\nIf the Bitcoin price can flip $18,000 and trend higher on the back of institutional allocation to alternative assets, the cryptocurrency could reclaim higher levels. The trading desk points to $28,000 as a critical level to watch.\nThis level is the neckline of the “Head and Shoulders” pattern formed by BTC in the past two years. In addition, $28,000 has confluence with the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level, meaning many players will keep an eye on it.\nWhat Could Operate As An Obstacle For Bitcoin\nIn the short term, the Bitcoin price is seeing resistance at its current levels.

The awareness campaign will also highlight the risks of investing in crypto assets. The first-of-its-kind campaign will be overseen by the Investor Protection and Education Fund Authority – a government body controlled by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs.

Most recently, the Indian central bank governor Shaktikanta Das, said that cryptocurrencies should be banned, and if allowed to grow, might be the cause of the next financial crisis.\nThe government is preparing to regulate cryptocurrencies, but Das followed suit with the opinion of other central bankers and leaders of global financial bodies by saying that crypto had no underlying value and posed a risk for macroeconomic and financial stability. Das sternly commented:\nMark my words, next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies…After FTX episode, don’t think we need to say anything more on crypto.\nThe governor has urged that cryptocurrencies be banned:\nIt should be prohibited because if it is allowed to grow … say it’s regulated and allowed to grow … please mark my words that the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies.\nIndia’s Harsh Crypto Tax is Forcing Traders to Foreign Exchanges\nWhen the new Indian tax law came into effect on March 31, 2022, it obligated citizens trading in crypto to pay a capital gains tax of 30% on their crypto. As if that is not harsh enough, traders have also been required to pay a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every single transaction. According to TechCrunch, which cites a new report by Esya, these almost draconian tax rates have finally caught up to local cryptocurrency exchanges and have resulted in local exchanges “ceding the lion’s share of the market to those operated by foreign players.”\nData from Delhi-based think tank Esya, report that Binance, Coinbase, and other foreign exchanges command 67.6% of the cryptocurrency market share in India as of October 2022 - up from 50% in November 2021. Esya’s report says that during the period between February 2022, when the country’s new tax policy was unveiled, and October 2022, a whopping $3.8 billion of trading volume shifted from domestic centralised exchanges to foreign-operated exchanges. Locally operated exchanges including WazirX, CoinSwitch, and CoinDCX lost 81% of their trading volume in the time between July and October 2022. The major loss by locally operated exchanges is attributed to the fact that traders argue that by moving their assets to foreign exchanges will mask their activities from local authorities. Many foreign exchanges such as KuCoin allow trading, within certain capital limits, without requiring KYC details.\nEsya concludes its report by urging the Indian government to re-evaluate its crypto tax policy.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

After much wrangling from the SEC, Ripple confirmed in October that it now possessed the highly sought-after Hinman emails.\nI haven’t become more pessimistic.

I just believe if the case was going to settle b/c of the emails it would’ve. — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 3, 2023\nWith the motions for summary judgment and to exclude expert testimonies now fully briefed, John Deaton believes a court verdict is more likely than one of settlement. In recent tweets, Deaton voiced his opinion that the Ripple case might not settle because of the Hinman emails.\nAccording to him, \"Judge Torres has implied that the Hinman emails, drafts, and comments are relevant only for purposes of cross-examination or impeachment. I don’t believe they are as damaging as people (including me) once believed. If they were, I believe the case would’ve settled by now and the emails wouldn’t have been turned over to Ripple.\"\nAccording to U.Today, the majority of the XRP community — up to 59% — believes the case will be settled. Some market commentators also opine that the case might settle.\nIn his 2023 predictions, Miles Deutscher predicts that the XRP court case will come to an end this year. \"After long and drawn-out proceedings for the last couple of years, I expect a final resolution. It's likely to come to an end via a settlement. Remember, a win for XRP is a win for crypto,\" he wrote.\nAccording to Deaton, a settlement could happen for any reason other than the Hinman emails. In earlier tweets, Deaton opined, \"The only other reason for Gensler to settle is to avoid a ruling setting a bad precedent for the SEC as it goes against other tokens. But, to be honest, I just don't think he’s too worried about it. There's been a push for the CFTC to oversee crypto, so Gensler may roll the dice.\"\nHe further added, \"In sum, unfortunately, I think a settlement with Ripple is not in Gensler's mindset. I don't believe he's going to settle and publicly agree that ongoing and future XRP sales, including in the secondary market, are non-securities. And Ripple won't settle unless the SEC so agrees.\"\nAccording to James K.

With the sector still largely unregulated, it can be difficult for individuals to protect themselves from unscrupulous actors looking to take advantage of unsuspecting investors.\nLegal uncertainties are also a significant concern. Issues related to custody practices, redemptions, and ownership rights can all be murky and confusing, and some of these issues are currently the subject of legal proceedings.\nIn addition, some crypto-asset companies have been accused of making inaccurate or misleading representations and disclosures. This includes misrepresentations about federal deposit insurance and other practices that may be deceptive or abusive. These types of practices can cause significant harm to retail and institutional investors, customers, and counterparties.\nThe volatility of crypto-asset markets is another major risk. This volatility can have a range of impacts, including the potential for deposit flows associated with crypto-asset companies to be affected.\nStablecoins, which are designed to maintain a stable value, can also be a \"run risk,\" which could lead to deposit outflows for banking organisations that hold stablecoin reserves.\nThe interconnected nature of the crypto-asset sector also presents risks, as contagion within the sector is possible through opaque lending, investing, funding, service, and operational arrangements. These interconnections could also create concentration risks for banking organisations with exposures to the crypto-asset sector.\nThe risk management and governance practices in the crypto-asset sector have been criticised for being immature and lacking robustness.\nThe use of open, public, and decentralised networks also carries its own set of risks, including the lack of governance mechanisms, unclear roles and responsibilities, and vulnerabilities to cyber attacks and outages.\nIn outlining all of these perceived risks, the 3 governmental bodies have sought to make all banks publicly aware of them. However, it does make it clear that banks are not prohibited from providing banking services “of any specific class or type”, as long as they fall within the law.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The candidate in question is Javier Gerardo Milei, who is currently a federal deputy from Buenos Aires and has been compared by many to former U.S. President Donald Trump and departing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\nMilei, who is currently running for Argentina’s 2023 presidential election, can be classified as a die-hard Bitcoiner who preaches the Austrian school of economic thought and calls himself an “anarcho-capitalist.” In previous interviews, he said he wants to “kick the ass of Keynesians and collectivists” and is raffling off his monthly salary to counter a government that he believes is “stealing” from ordinary Argentine citizens.\nBitcoin Is The Answer To Central Banks\nIn a recent interview, Milei was asked if he believes it is possible to discuss Bitcoin as a means of payment in Argentina. And the presidential candidate delivered an answer that could have made Satoshi Nakamoto proud. Milei said that the core problem which people must first understand is that “the Central Bank is a scam. It is a mechanism by which politicians cheat the good people with the inflationary tax.”\nMilei went on to say Bitcoin is “representing the return of money to its original creator: the private sector. Money is a private invention.” According to the Argentine politician, legal tenders are the key “to the politician to scam you with the inflationary tax. Bitcoin has an algorithm that one day it will reach a certain amount and there is no more and it can compete with other currencies.”\nMilei reinforced his point and went on to say that the problem is that governments and central banks do not want to give up legal tender because they “can scam [the people] with inflationary tax,” and concluded:\nBitcoin is the natural reaction against the Central Bank scammers and to make money private again. […] In economies with high inflation, the scam problem is bigger. That’s why, as I suggest, you can propose to close the Central Bank.\nHow Likely Is The Rise Of Argentina’s Bukele?\nMilei is likely to lead the La Libertad Avanza coalition and has the support of 24% of respondents, according to an October 2022 poll by AmericaElects.\nRemarkably, the poll was done before one of Milei’s biggest political rivals, current Vice President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, withdrew her candidacy. A court sentenced her in December to six years in prison for corruption, which also bars her from future political office. With her departure, Milei’s relative lead could likely grow.\nBut as the coalitions have not officially announced their candidates, the outlines of Argentina’s election are unclear at the moment. Bitcoin supporters, however, can hope for a promising candidate who could possibly follow the example of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele.\nAt press time, Bitcoin traded at $16,844, seeing a slight uptick of 0,85% in the last 24 hours.\nFeatured image from Angelica Reyes/ Unsplash and Perfil, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-04 09:10:12", "entity": ["avalanche", "holdstation", "odos protocol", "avalanche", "avax", "avax", "avax", "ethereum", "bitcoin", "btc", "ftx", "avax", "avax", "trading btc", "s & p 500", "dow jones index", "avax", "avax", "avalanche", "avalanche", "coinbase", "usdc", "avalanche", "avaxholic", "twitter", ". re", "avalanche", "re", "avalanche", "avax", "avalanche", "coinmarketcap", "avax", "avalanche", "us federal reserve", "fed", "avax", "dara rehab"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral"], "content": "The 2022 crypto bear market left a deep mark on the Avalanche ecosystem.

This pump in price is due to certain bullish factors that will play a role in Avalanche’s 2023 recovery.\nDevelopments On-chain Increasing\nAlthough the past year has been very bearish in terms of the crypto market’s pricing, developments on-chain are going strong. On December 30, Avalanche pushed its Incentives Program to promote dApp development on the Avalanche ecosystem.\nDecember also saw the integration of Coinbase’s USDC which will certainly bring more people into Avalanche and the crypto economy as a whole.\nAvaxholic, a popular Twitter account dedicated to updates about the ecosystem, recently tweeted about the current state of developments on-chain.

This can present a few challenges as the token is testing the $11.66 price resistance level.\nThe king crypto received a beating last year with BTC continuing its sideways price movement after FTX collapsed. This price movement can be broken as January is chock full of macroeconomic indicators that would directly influence the broader financial market, especially AVAX.\nAVAX total market cap at $3.6 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com\nWith BTC being slightly correlated with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Index, a worsening macroeconomic trend will affect the king crypto, dragging AVAX along with it.\nThis week will be crucial for AVAX as the Federal Open Market Meeting Minutes and the US Nonfarm Payrolls will be released.\nThese would give insight into what the US Federal Reserve’s next step would be regarding the inflation situation. If the Fed ever decides to raise interest rates once again, AVAX might lose its current footing.\nAs of writing, however, the token has already breached the $11.66 resistance level.

Yesterday, Garlinghouse took to Twitter again to deliver a prediction for 2023.\nThe Ripple CEO explained that yesterday was the first day of the 118th U.S. Congress, and while efforts to bring regulatory clarity to crypto in the U.S. have stalled on and off in recent years, he expects that 2023 is the year “we will (finally!) see a breakthrough.”\nHere’s Why Ripple CEO Says 2023 Could Be Different\nGarlinghouse reasons that support for regulation is bipartisan and bicameral. Leaders have publicly supported blockchain technology and recognized the need for clarity.\nSpecifically, the Ripple CEO supports the policy pushes of Patrick McHenry (Republican), Glenn “GT” Thompson (Republican), Tom Emmer (Republican), Ritchie Torres (Democrat), Ro Khanna (Democrat), Sen. Debbie Stabenow (Democrat), John Boozman (Republican), Kirsten Gillibrand (Democrat), Sen. Cynthia Lummis (Republican), and Cory Booker (Democrat).\nAs the Ripple CEO says, the industry is no longer working with a blank sheet of paper. “Prior bills have tried to address everything from stablecoins and CEXs (RFIA and DCEA); clearer definitions of what constitutes a digital asset security (Securities Clarity Act); safe harbors (Clarity for Digital Tokens Act) and more,” Garlinghouse elaborated.\nAt the same time, he expressed that no bill is perfect and there will likely never be one that satisfies everyone. “But perfect shouldn’t be the enemy of progress.” According to him, the proposals offer a basis for discussion, and the “stakes couldn’t be higher.”\nAs in previous tweets and the court documents in the legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Garlinghouse points to other countries that he sees as leading the way for the crypto industry. “Singapore, the EU, Brazil, and Japan all have crypto frameworks – and the UK is well ahead of the US,” the Ripple CEO says.\nHe also warns of the danger of non-regulation in the U.S. The lack of coordinated standards globally or any in the U.S. continues to push businesses to countries with lower regulatory bars. “BG” cites the collapse of FTX as a bad example with a disastrous outcome.\nLooking optimistically into the future, the Ripple CEO concludes his hope with the following words:\nChanging the status quo is never easy but I believe that the will to act exists. The building blocks for regulation have already been introduced, […] The 118th Congress has a historic opportunity before it to ensure the US remains an innovation leader for decades to come. We hope it’s one they take.\nAt press time, XRP was down 0.8% in the last 24 hours and the price stood at $0.3473, facing major resistance at $0.3539\nFeatured image from Protocol.com, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-04 08:31:00", "entity": ["nft", "cardano nft", "jpgstore", "hoskinson", "nft", "t. co", "cardano", "nft", "u.", "snoop dogg", "nft", "real nft", "cardano", "cardano", "twitter", "cardano", "nft"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "A major controversy erupted in the Cardano community today, sparked directly by the project's founder Charles Hoskinson.

The Cardano founder summed up his take by saying that he got a cool profile photo and saved money.\nInterestingly, the NFT that Hoskinson put as his profile photo the day before was purchased for 10,000 ADA, the equivalent of $2,700.\nTo buy or not to buy?\nMany people did not like this kind of attitude toward digital art and the intellectual rights that NFT ownership is supposed to enshrine. So, the CEO of large Cardano NFT marketplace JPGstore, Blakelock Brown, said that Hoskinson should have bought a real NFT and thus set an example, as well as support the NFT industry.\nBuy an NFT? I'm not buying the IP nor am I signing a contract giving me royalty free use to display.

The embattled former CEO appeared before a judge at the U.S. District Court in New York City, in tow with his lawyers. Bankman-Fried had founded Alameda Research in 2017 and went on to establish FTX in 2019.\nBankman-Fried was expected to plead not guilty and could now be part of a lengthy legal battle, facing up to 115 years in prison if convicted.\nTrial To Commence In October 2023\nThe court set the tentative trial date as 2nd October 2022, with prosecutors expected to present evidence related to the case to the court over the next four weeks. Additionally, Bankman-Fried is also not allowed to access any FTX or Alameda Research assets. The judge also agreed to a request to withhold the identities of two individuals, other than Bankman-Fried’s parents, who helped secure bail for the former CEO. The request was approved following reports that his parents have been subject to threats and harassment. According to lawyers,\n“His parents have, in recent weeks, become the target of intense media scrutiny, harassment, and threats. Among other things, Mr. Bankman-Fried’s parents have received a steady stream of threatening correspondence, including communications expressing a desire that they suffer physical harm.”\nSBF was released on a bond of $250 million, which is the largest-ever pretrial bond. Under the bail conditions, Bankman-Fried will also have to wear an “electronic monitoring bracelet,” attend mental health counseling, and remain under house arrest at his parents’ house in California.\nGary Wang, Caroline Ellison Plead Guilty\nBack in December, FTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang and Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison pleaded guilty to criminal charges connected with the collapse of FTX. Both are also facing penalties from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the CTFC, along with criminal charges brought by prosecutors. Both executives have stated they intend to cooperate with the authorities and will play a critical role as witnesses, given their close equation with Bankman-Fried, FTX, and Alameda Research.\nA Risky Move\nTo many observers, Bankman-Fried’s plea is a risky move in stark contrast to that of his colleagues, Wang and Ellison, who both plead guilty. Many view his actions as cocky, given that he went on a full media tour before his arrest, appearing on several shows and Twitter spaces talks. Bankman-Fried was finally arrested in the Bahamas and then extradited to the United States in December.\nThe FTX Fiasco\nThe chaos at FTX saw Bankman-Fried step down as CEO, replaced by Enron veteran John Ray III. During the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Ray was the only witness, with Bankman-Fried unable to join after his arrest. The hearing saw Ray reveal the extent to which customer funds were misused and the lack of internal controls and risk management systems. He also disclosed that there was no board overseeing operations at FTX, and neither did the exchange have an accounting or Human Resources department.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The team behind the protocol fixed the bug, and the affected components were successfully redeployed—otherwise, an attacker could have tempered with transactions to steal a user’s funds.\nUniswap Avoids Danger And Fixes New Features\nAccording to the security firm, the vulnerability was unintentionally implemented with the Universal Router. This component allows Uniswap users to trade ERC-20 tokens and non-fungible tokens “into a single swap router.”\nIn other words, Uniswap users can optimize their operations and trade multiple tokens and NFTs in a single transaction, saving time and money. This new component also allows users to transfer funds to third parties.\nWhen the vulnerability was in-placed, a user could send a transaction to a third party, and the latter could have gained access to the sender’s funds. Dedaub explained the following:\n(…) if third-party code is invoked at any point in the transfer (which manifests itself due to composition of protocols), the code can reenter the UniversalRouter and claim any tokens temporarily in the contract (…). The attacker also needs to implement code to reenter the router (calling execute) and sweep all token amounts. The router may contain funds mid-transaction due to other actions and transfers in a complex swap.\nThe Universal Router hold the sender’s funds while the transaction is completed. While this happened, the funds were vulnerable, and a bad actor could drain them by calling specific commands such as “dispatch” with a “.TRANSFER” or. “.SWEEP.”\nThe vulnerability could have allowed a bad actor to “re-entered” a transaction using this command. Once inside, the attacker could have been able to “drain the entire amount” from the sender’s wallet.\nThe security firm added the following on the “endless scenarios” where the vulnerability could have been exploited:\nIf untrusted code is invoked at any point in the transfer, the code can re-enter the UniversalRouter and claim any tokens already in the UniversalRouter contract. Such tokens can, for instance, exist because the user intends to later buy an NFT, or transfer tokens to a second recipient, or because the user swaps a larger amount than needed and intends to “sweep” the remainder to themselves at the end of the UniversalRouter call. And there is no shortage of scenarios in which an untrusted recipient may be called (…).\nEthereum DEX Grants $3 Million In Bug Bounty\nIn December 2022, Uniswap launched the Universal Router as part of their new NFT compatibility. At that time, Uniswap Labs announced a $3 million bounty program. Dedaub was granted this amount for their bug report on the new component.\nThe firm celebrated the reward and the fact that a bad actor never exploited the vulnerability. In addition, the security firm was “the only bug report that Uniswap acted upon.”\n2022 was a troublesome year for crypto and risk-on assets, while macroeconomic forces played against the nascent sector. Users experienced hurdles beyond declining prices as hackers and bad actors took billions from the industry.\nData from on-chain analytics firm Chainalysis claims that bad actors have received over $26 billion in cryptocurrency from 2017 to 2021 alone. It remains to be seen if 2023 will extend or mitigate this trend.\nAs of this writing, UNI’s price trades at $5.70 with sideways movement on the daily chart."}, {"date": "2023-01-03 23:48:54", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "\"Every dollar I could find I would put into [crypto casino] Stake in hopes of winning big,\" he wrote. \"Even when the big wins did happen it wasn’t enough.

Magic Eden, which also supports NFTs on Ethereum and Polygon, tweeted late Tuesday afternoon that “a third-party service” used for caching images had been compromised. Users began tweeting about the issue late Monday.\nAD\nAD\n“Your NFTs are safe and Magic Eden has not been hacked,” the marketplace tweeted. “Unfortunately, you might've seen some um, unsavory images.

However, some users were still seeing the unexpected images and needed to hard refresh their web browser, so the statement was made.\nThe company does not believe that it was specifically targeted via the hack on the third-party vendor, a representative added, which Magic Eden believes affected other websites as well. The NFT startup would not name the image caching partner due to security concerns.\nAn NFT is a blockchain token that represents ownership of a unique item, including digital goods such as artwork, collectibles, and video game items.

The low trading volume and low activity because of the holiday contributed to the current price action.\nThe Bitcoin Price Near A Bottom, But Profits Remain Elusive\nAccording to analyst Caleb Franzen, the Bitcoin price registered another indication of a bottom. Franzen and others have been tracking down the clues that could support a bullish thesis for BTC, and the Heikin Ashi printed a positive signal.\nThe Heikin Ashi is a technique to visualize price action and create candlestick charts to measure trends in a market. Franzen claims the Bitcoin price printed its 13th consecutive monthly Heikin Ashi on December 22.\nThe last time BTC saw a similar trend was at the end of the 2018 and 2015 bear markets. This data supports a positive outlook for the Bitcoin price and hints at a bullish potential in the coming months. The analyst stated:\nEach red streak has been longer than the last & we’re currently building #14 for January ’23. Historically, a green monthly candle after 5+ red monthly candles has marked the end of each bear market.\nAs mentioned, Franzen and other metrics point to Bitcoin forming a bottom at its current levels.

The digital asset eventually recovered but it remains shaky even now a new report from Santiment shows that there could be a bull case for the cryptocurrency. This bull case is tied to large XRP holders who have been accumulating coins over the past six months.\nA Bull Case For XRP\nThe report from Santiment starts out with the revelation that large investors holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP tokens have been increasing their bags aggressively. Apparently, over the last six years, these investors raised their collective balances by 25%. This now meant that they were holding more than 4 billion XRP.\nSantiment notes that such accumulation trends were important given that they are often observed during bear market bottoms. Basically, when these whales go on a buying spree such as this, it is when the price has already reached its lowest point in the bear market.\nSo if history is anything to go by and this was to have the same effects as previously seen, then it could mean that there is a bull rally in scope for the digital asset. Additionally, it explains that the MVRV 30 for the altcoin shows that short-term holders were seeing losses of 7% on average. So this points to a hesitancy to sell among these holders because they do not want to take a loss.\nThis refusal to dump tokens and whales adding to their balances adds up to less supply hitting the market while demand is on the rise. Basic laws of economics will easily put this as a recipe for a jump in the price of assets, hence the bull case for XRP.\nXRP price continues to struggle at $0.34 | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView.com\nBut What If This Isn’t The Case?\nOne thing that XRP holders have to take into account is the Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple. This case is yet to be concluded and it continues to put a damper on the price of XRP. To know just how much of an effect it had, while most cryptocurrencies in the market were hitting new all-time highs, XRP’s price had declined, unable to even reclaim its own all-time high price from 2018.\nWhat this shows is that until the case with the SEC is concluded, XRP will continue to struggle in the market. Furthermore, if the final judgment were to be against Ripple, then investors should expect a rapid decline in the price of the asset.\nThe only thing that can categorically determine if there is a bull rally coming for the altcoin would be for the outcome of the case to be in favor of Ripple. Until then, the price of the digital asset is expected to trade sideways, as well as lag behind the general crypto market.\nFeatured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 23:00:05", "entity": ["btc", "btcus", "cnbc", "bitcoin", "federal reserve", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "mobius", "standard chartered", "sussex university", "cnbc", "btc", "cnbc", "standard chartered", "bloomberg", "bitcoin", "mcglone", "btc", "bitcoin", "draper", "cnbc", "shapeshift exchange", "voorhees", "bankless", "bitcoin", "voorhees", "cryptocurrency", "marca", "tradingview. com", "##coin bitcoin", "standard chartered", "btc", "btc", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "Bitcoin predictions have been rolled out with the start of the new year. These predictions come from prominent personalities in the space who have shared where they think the price of the digital asset is headed. Some of these are bullish while others err more on the bearish side. Here are the top 5 bitcoin predictions for the year 2023 from most bullish to most bearish.\nTim Draper Says $250,000\nBillionaire Tim Draper has always had high hopes for bitcoin, giving it a $250,000 price mark for the year 2023. While Draper has adjusted the timeline a bit, he has not let up on his prediction. In an email to CNBC, the billionaire investor reiterated that he believes that the digital asset is still headed for $250,000.\nAccording to him, the more women, who control 80% of retail spending, are drawn into BTC, the price of the asset will explode. He expects the $250,000 mark to be reached before the next bitcoin halving, saying he expects the “halvening in 2024 will have a positive run.”\nCarol Alexander Puts Bitcoin At $50,000\nAnother prediction that the CNBC report highlights is that of a professor of finance at Sussex University. Professor Carol Alexander takes a more conservative stance compared to Tim Draper with her prediction that the digital asset would hit $50,000 sometime in 2023.\nHowever, Alexander does not expect this to happen soon but rather believes that it would be in Q3 or Q4 2023 when this would happen. She expects another bull market in the year but nothing like the previous one as she believes will be a “managed bull managed.” As for who will drive this, the professor expects large BTC whales to be behind the rally.\n“We’ll see a month or two of stable trending prices interspersed with range-bounded periods and probably a couple of short-lived crashes,” Alexander told CNBC.\nErik Voorhees Goes With $40,000\nErik Voorhees is a notable name in the crypto space being the founder of the ShapeShift exchange. Coming through with his prediction for the year, Voorhees told Bankless in a Monday interview that he expects the price of bitcoin to reach $40,000 by June. While not as bullish as the first two, it would be about a 150% increase from the current price.\nOne thing that Voorhees couldn’t decide on though was when he expects the next bull market to happen. He put a timeline of around six months to 3 years for when the next bull run would likely happen. However, he believes that there is a revolution going on regardless of whether there is a bull or bear market.\nBTC price at mid-$16,000 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\nMark Mobius Goes Lower With $10,000\nDeviating completely from the incredibly bullish predictions of others, Mark Mobius, a veteran investor, told CNBC that he actually expects bitcoin to fall to $10,000 in 2023. He points to the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve as being a deterrent for investors who may be interested in buying or holding bitcoin. For him, since bitcoin does not pay any interest, it does not entice investors.\nFor Mobius’ prediction, if it does come to pass, it would mean another 50% decline for the digital asset in the year 2023 after crashing more than 60% in 2022. But the investor sticks to his guns as he expects this to be the case.\nStandard Chartered Goes Scorched Earth At $5,000\nPerhaps an interesting thing about bitcoin and its investors is that it is not expected that bitcoin would fall even close to the previous market bottom but Standard Chartered does not share this sentiment. The global banking giant released its predictions for BTC which turned out to be arguably one of the most bearish cases for the industry so far.\nThe bank expects the price of BTC to fall another 70% and reach as low as $5,000 in 2023. It points to the fact that technology shares continue to decline and expects bitcoin to do so too, as well as the reduced liquidity in the crypto sector pushing many companies to file for bankruptcy.\n“More and more crypto firms and exchanges find themselves with insufficient liquidity, leading to further bankruptcies and a collapse in investor confidence in digital assets,” said Eric Robertsen, Standard Chartered’s global head of research.\nBonus – Mike McGlone Guns For $100,000\nIn 2022, Bloomberg analyst and Senior Commodity Strategist Mike McGlone gave his own predictions for the future of bitcoin but placed it on a much longer timeframe compared to others. McGlone expects the price of BTC to reach $100,000 but not until 2025.\nHis own prediction hinges on the simple supply and demand framework. The analyst says the supply of the cryptocurrency is on the decline and demand is going up. Given this, he believes that it is only a “matter of time” until the digital asset is trading at $100,000.\nFeatured image from MARCA, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 22:58:09", "entity": ["twitter", "bankman - fried", "ftx", "ftx", "alameda research", "bankman - fried", "alameda", "bankman - fried", "ftx", "bankman - fried", "alameda", "bank alameda", "alameda", "arkham intelligence", "ftx", "ftx"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "A modification was made to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried’s bond agreement on Tuesday, prohibiting him from accessing or transferring funds related to FTX or Alameda Research as a new condition of his bail.\nThe request was made by Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon during Bankman-Fried’s arraignment in Manhattan, acting on behalf of the government. Judge Lewis A. Kaplan, who presides over Bankman-Fried’s case, granted the measure.\nAD\nAD\nAt the proceeding, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to the eight criminal charges that include fraud and money laundering. A trial date for Bankman-Fried of October 2 was also set during the proceeding.\nThe amendment follows activity involving Alameda-linked wallets that took place last week. Just days after Bankman-Fried was released on bail, around $1.7 million worth of cryptocurrencies linked to Alameda was transferred to coin mixers—programs often used to obscure trading activity—according to Arkham Intelligence.\nAfter he was arrested in the Bahamas and spent several days at a correctional center, Bankman-Fried was released from custody upon his return to the U.S. As part of a bond agreement, the home of Bankman-Fried’s parents in California was posted as collateral, and he agreed to electronic monitoring, house arrest, among other requirements.\nAlameda is Bankman-Fried’s trading firm, which was founded before the launch of FTX. A portion of the charges that Bankman-Fried faces stem from accusations that customer funds were illicitly transferred to Alameda to fund its bets.\nAfter reports regarding last week’s transfers began to circulate, Bankman-Fried tweeted for the first time since he was arrested in the Bahamas, denying he was behind the activity that involved Alameda-linked wallets.\n“None of these are me,” he stated on Twitter. “I'm not and couldn't be moving any of those funds; I don't have access to them anymore.”\nNone of these are me.

Both officials occupy offices just steps from the Oval Office, a sign of their status in the administration.\nAll of Bankman-Fried’s meetings with Ricchetti and Reed took place in the West Wing.\nBankman-Fried’s brother, Gabriel Bankman-Fried, also met with senior White House officials twice in 2022.\nWhile most of the meetings took place in the spring, records released at the end of December revealed that Bankman-Fried returned to the White House for a fourth meeting in September, just weeks before the crypto mogul’s $32 billion empire collapsed in historic fashion.\nIn the early fall, at the time of Bankman-Fried’s final visit to the White House, the then-billionaire was lobbying lawmakers to pass the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), a framework for crypto regulation that, while potentially devastating to some sectors of the crypto industry, would have treated centralized exchanges like FTX much more favorably.\nIn the wake of FTX’s abrupt demise and Bankman-Fried’s arrest in December for eight criminal charges—including conspiracy to commit fraud, money laundering, and violation of federal campaign finance laws—the bill has since been put on hold.\nIn the months preceding Bankman-Fried’s downfall, the crypto executive donated some $46.5 million to political causes, including $5 million to a political action committee (PAC) that fueled a national pro-Biden ad blitz in the final weeks of the 2020 presidential election.\nAD\nAD\nMultiple politicians have since returned those donations or donated equivalent amounts to charity.\nPress Secretary Jean-Pierre, however, has refused to comment regarding whether the President will return any donations made by Bankman-Fried, or thinks any other Democratic politicians should.\nOn Tuesday, Jean-Pierre doubled down on that refusal.\n“I don’t have anything to share,” she said."}, {"date": "2023-01-03 21:55:18", "entity": ["empiredao", "fraietta", "empiredao", "atx dao"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "While EmpireDAO’s SoHo location is shutting its doors, Fraietta has plans to eventually re-open in another spot for “Season 2” of the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), along with potential EmpireDAO pop-ups at upcoming crypto conferences, as well as this year’s SXSW in Austin, Texas, in partnership with ATX DAO."}, {"date": "2023-01-03 21:20:36", "entity": ["##coin", "libra", "stablecoins", "terra", "securities exchange commission", "sec", "sec", "sec", "sec", "sec", "ethereum", "eth", "eth", "ethereum", "ethereum", "eth", "defi", "new york stock exchange", "defi education fund", "whitehouse - levine", "whitehouse - levine", "ftx", "ftx", "liquid global", "ftx", "sino global", "ftx", "crypto group coinshares", "ftx", "ethereum", "ftx", "ftx", "digital asset lender", "blockfi", "commodity futures trading commission", "cftc", "ftx", "ftx", "ftx", "stablecoin", "stablecoin", "facebook", "sec", "american government", "defi education fund", "american finance", "ethereum", "ethereum", "sec", "gensler", "sec", "ftx", "sec", "ad ad whitehouse", "sec", "##um ethereum", "decrypt", "ethereum", "ethereum", "ethereum", "eth withdrawals", "ethereum", "ethereum"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "If 2022 made one thing clear about crypto, it’s that there’s absolutely no point in predicting anything.\nOvernight collapses of multi-billion dollar companies, historic technological achievements, industry-wide crashes, blockbuster confrontations with world governments, shocking revelations of corporate malfeasance, billionaires on the run, surprise arrests: 2022 had it all—if not too much.\nAD\nAD\nWhere does crypto go from here? While the future may not be certain, it's too tempting not to make some educated guesses. A number of 2022’s seismic events will certainly reverberate well into the new year; some new trends, too, are poised to play a major role in shaping what already looks to be another critical year for crypto.\nHere are some potential answers to a few questions likely to have major implications for the industry in 2023.\nWhen will winter end?\nBy late fall, the crypto market looked poised for a recovery after months of relentless battering: the stock market was coming up for air, inflation was slowing, and prognostications for 2023 were cautiously optimistic.\nThen, one of crypto’s most prominent institutions exploded in real time.\nThe stunning collapse last month of crypto exchange FTX cratered crypto prices, sending Bitcoin to its worst low in two years. Ethereum plunged to almost $1,100 in late November, due to a combination of market-wide panic and the dumping of millions of dollars worth of ETH by an attacker who purportedly drained FTX wallets in the midst of the company’s unraveling.\nCrypto prices have since marginally recovered, but the contagion sparked by FTX’s collapse only continues to spread. Digital asset lender BlockFi, which took a $250 million line of credit from FTX over the summer, declared bankruptcy late last month, weeks after freezing all withdrawals.\nThe company joined the ranks of a litany of crypto firms impacted by FTX’s demise. Cryptocurrency exchange Liquid Global, acquired by FTX earlier in the year, froze all fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawals just days after its parent company collapsed; Sino Global, a blockchain-focused venture firm, confirmed “mid-seven figure” exposure to FTX; crypto investment and trading group CoinShares confirmed a $30.3 million exposure; crypto prime broker Genesis suffered a whopping $175 million exposure to FTX, and suspended client withdrawals for its lending arm as a result; crypto lender SALT also paused withdrawals.\nAs 2023 unfolds, it's all-but-certain that even more firms will be forced to disclose potentially devastating relationships with once-dominant FTX, which seemed to have spread its tendrils across every corner of the crypto industry.\nAD\nAD\nUntil the full impact of FTX’s $32 billion collapse is accounted for, and its myriad connections are divulged and processed, it’s unlikely a crypto spring will be able to take hold. With crypto contagion looking unlikely to let up any time soon, color us surprised if the proverbial line goes up before actual spring.\nCrypto laws, finally?\nDespite the crypto-related cacophony and controversy that emanated from Washington this year, there remains a jarring lack of clarity from the American government about the regulatory fate of crypto assets, protocols, and exchanges. Will 2023 finally bring some solid guidelines and guardrails?\n“I am less bullish on regulatory clarity,” Miller Whitehouse-Levine, policy director of crypto lobbying group DeFi Education Fund, told Decrypt about 2023’s prospects.\nWith control of Congress set to be narrowly split between Democrats and Republicans in 2023, Whitehouse-Levine is skeptical that warring political factions will be able to put aside their differences to pass sweeping crypto regulatory legislation.\n“I think it's going to be difficult for those two constituencies—each with completely different views on crypto policy—to come to a consensus that can pass Congress,” he said.\nOne bipartisan crypto bill that looked poised to go the distance now appears all-but doomed. The Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), also known as the Stabenow-Boozman bill, would have granted crypto regulatory powers to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and was by late 2022 gaining traction on the Hill.\nOne of the bill’s most prominent supporters, though, was now-disgraced FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, who favored the bill’s mainstreaming of centralized crypto exchanges like FTX. Weeks after FTX’s historic collapse, the bill was put on hold. It appears seismic changes in political calculus may have permanently sealed its fate.\nThere is, however, one area of crypto legislation with potential for movement in 2023: stablecoin regulation.\n“If anything moves, stablecoin regulation seems to be the area where action is most likely to occur legislatively,” Whitehouse-Levine said. “Seemingly everyone agrees that something needs to be done, and everyone wants a deal.”\nOutgoing House Financial Services Committee Chair Maxine Waters (D-CA) and incoming Chair Patrick McHenry (R-NC) have been working towards a stablecoin bill for years, ever since Facebook stirred panic with its since-thwarted attempt to create its own stablecoin, Libra.\nAD\nAD\nIn the absence of any comprehensive legislation, stablecoins have continued to make headlines: in May, so-called algorithmic stablecoin UST depegged from the US dollar, collapsing its maker, Terra, wiping out some $40 billion in value, and kickstarting crypto’s current winter.\nSEC vs crypto\nAnother key character in crypto’s ongoing, unfolding battle with Washington is the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and headline-grabbing head honcho Gary Gensler.\nGensler made waves in 2022 for escalating enforcement actions against crypto companies without providing baseline rules or guidelines for the emergent industry. Gensler’s own colleague, SEC commissioner Hester Peirce, previously labeled such policies of education by enforcement “just not a good way of regulating,” in an interview with Decrypt.\nWill 2023 bring any clarity, good or bad for crypto, from the SEC?\nOne major crypto development on deck at the SEC is a suite of pending updates to the agency’s rules on security exchanges. The SEC has released a proposed draft of its revised rules, which defines security exchanges in extremely broad terms that appear poised to ensnare decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\nThe rule is currently in the comments stage, and has not yet been adopted. If adopted next year in its current form, the rule could have devastating consequences for DeFi, essentially requiring the sector to be regulated as a securities marketplace.\n“If a DeFi protocol is required to be regulated like the New York Stock Exchange, obviously that is totally impossible,” DeFi Education Fund’s Whitehouse-Levine said. “It would effectively make smart contracts illegal in the US.”\nWhitehouse-Levine is confident, however, that if such a rule were adopted, it would be challenged and potentially overturned in federal court.\nWhat’s more, the SEC may soon be embroiled in political problems of its own.\nRepublican lawmakers—and some Democrats—have recently ramped up criticism of Gensler and the SEC’s inability or unwillingness to produce concrete rules on crypto assets. In the wake of FTX’s collapse in November, Representative Tom Emmer (R-MN) demanded that Gensler testify before Congress, linking 2022’s slew of crypto company collapses to the SEC’s enduring failure to create a crypto regulatory framework.\nAD\nAD\nWhitehouse-Levine believes that, with Republicans soon to take charge of the House, stern words could soon evolve into real consequences for the federal regulator.\n“Every regulatory agency reports back to Congress, so there's a lot they [Republicans] can do,” Whitehouse-Levine said. “For example, they could say, until the SEC issues rulemaking on digital assets, they can't spend any of this money on enforcement. It could be quite impactful.”\nWill Ripple’s battle offer answers in crypto’s war?\nOne of 2022’s highest-profile—and still ongoing—crypto lawsuits saw blockchain payments company Ripple battle the SEC in federal court. The government asserts that the company’s XRP token was illegally sold as an unregistered security.\nThe lawsuit has pitted a dominant crypto company with deep pockets against a federal agency with much to prove—see above—in one of finance’s key arenas: the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. That court, colloquially referred to as the “Mother Court” by legal professionals, oversees all Wall Street activity and holds a particularly influential sway over federal finance law.\nWill the case, ongoing for almost two years, finally see resolution in 2023? And if it does, what will that verdict mean for crypto as a whole?\nSome experts believe that the SEC is angling to use its case against Ripple not just to prevent the unregistered sale of tokens like XRP, but to set the stage for the agency to finally go after centralized crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance.US—the beating hearts of America’s crypto trade.\nThe SEC, in its recent victory against blockchain-based publishing platform LBRY, successfully got a federal court to take the unprecedented step of labeling certain crypto tokens as securities in themselves, not just their sale as an illegal securities offering.\nIf the SEC can get its Manhattan-based judge to make a similar ruling on Ripple, the repercussions for crypto could be profound.\n“They want to go all the way and say the XRP tokens are the security,” Lewis Cohen, an attorney specializing in crypto and securities regulation, previously told Decrypt. “If they got their way, most US token marketplaces could not allow users to buy and sell ‘crypto securities’ without registering as an exchange or getting an exemption.”\nSuch an outcome would unquestionably upend the place of crypto exchanges in American finance, bringing stock exchange-caliber regulation to any entity trying to sell crypto assets.\nAD\nAD\n2023 will likely see either the realization of such a verdict, or an equally-consequential victory for Ripple, which would signify the dodging of a major bullet for the beleaguered industry.\nWhat next for Ethereum?\nFinally, some good news.\nSeptember’s historic Ethereum merge transitioned crypto’s dominant network to a proof of stake consensus mechanism that instantly cut its energy consumption by a whopping 99.99%, according to reports.\nAfter that technical triumph, what’s in store for Ethereum as it moves into 2023?\nFirst up will be the network’s Shanghai upgrade, expected to launch in March.\nShanghai will, first and foremost, enable withdrawals of staked ETH. Since the merge went live in September, users have been able to deposit existing ETH with the Ethereum network to help validate Ethereum transactions and create new ETH for themselves in the process. All staked ETH and newly generated ETH, however, have not yet been made available for withdrawal.\nCome March that will change, and some $20 billion worth of staked ETH will finally be made available to Ethereum users following the network’s Shanghai upgrade.\nEthereum’s core developers are so committed to rolling out staked ETH withdrawals that they’re trying to keep Shanghai as light as possible, eliminating other much-anticipated network upgrades from the update in the name of expeditiousness.\nOne such improvement that many hoped would be included in Shanghai is proto-danksharding, a preliminary version of a process by which huge amounts of data on Ethereum rollups—a tool used to combine many Ethereum transactions and treat them as one speedy, cheap transaction—will one day be verified by only sampling small pieces of data.\nDanksharding will take a process that already makes Ethereum transactions cheaper and faster, and make them far cheaper and faster. The update will dramatically increase the speed and ease with which huge amounts of data could be verified on Ethereum layer-2 networks like Optimism and Arbitrum.\nAD\nAD\nMany see danksharding as the key to Ethereum’s future proliferation and dominance as a reliable, secure network that’s also incredibly fast and inexpensive to use.\nWhile proto-danksharding may not come as soon as March, Ethereum’s developers hope it will still arrive by the end of next year.\n“I’m very confident that it will be shipped in 2023,” Ethereum core developer Marius Van Der Wijden told Decrypt. He expects the proto-danksharding tool to be included in Ethereum’s next upgrade after Shanghai, which has been tentatively labeled Cancun."}, {"date": "2023-01-03 21:01:23", "entity": ["ftx", "alameda research", "t. co", "ftx", "ftx", "federal reserve", "american banks", "federal reserve", "federal reserve", "federal deposit insurance corporation", "fdic", "office of comptroller of the currency", "occ", "ftx", "alameda research", "ftx", "bank moonstone", "ftx", "federal bank"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Federal Reserve and two other U.S. regulators today issued a warning to banks about cryptocurrencies.\nIn a joint statement, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said banks should be aware of the “significant volatility and vulnerabilities over the past year” the crypto industry experienced this year.\nAD\nAD\nThe regulators added that banks with exposure to crypto could especially be at risk.

He designed 2 of the 3 Beeple X Madonna NFTs, and has collaborated with top artists who include Katy Perry, Zedd, and Deadmau5.\nTony Herrera is a visionary with a long track record of building and innovating in the fields of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and NFTs. He is a founding member of Galaxis, and of several DAOs dedicated to the metaverse, including MeebitsDAO, NeonDAO, and ReadyPlayerDAO.\nThe Diamond Dawn NFT project\nDiamond Dawn is a project that matures over a 6-month period. The four phases of the project are similar to those of the natural diamond processing that takes place in the real world.\nAll of these steps are performed through an interactive interface designed by Asaf Snir, an expert with 15 years in website design specialising in unique visual experiences and parallax technologies.\nIn the first phase, the collector will mine a digital Rough Stone in Diamond Dawn’s virtual mine. Two further phases enable the collector to evolve their diamond until it reaches the perfection of the digital diamond designed by David Ariew.\nBox opening - a luxury design by Moldawsky that weighs 8kg and measures 25*25*25 cm\nThe fourth and final phase is when the collector has to make the choice of whether to keep the virtual digital diamond, or whether to have it transformed into its physical diamond form.\nIf they choose the physical diamond, they will receive a limited-edition art piece in the form of a GIA-certified diamond created by Moldawsky. The physical diamond will have exactly the same attributes of colour, shape, and carat weight of the NFT diamond.\nOne very important aspect of the project is that the NFT that backs the physical diamond is then destroyed by being burned. This will then give greater scarcity value to the remaining NFTs, potentially having the effect that they become more valuable than the physical diamonds themselves.\nThe diamonds are stored at the Moldawsky Diamonds vault, inside of the Israel Diamond Exchange, which is the largest diamond exchange in the world.\nAims of the project\nPrimarily, the Diamond Dawn project looks to demonstrate the power and ability of decentralised NFT technology to solve the very real problem of certification fraud and manipulation in the $100 billion diamond industry.\nAlso, the fact that blockchain and NFT technology is able to certify and verify a diamond’s provenance, will enable the tracking of diamonds mined in conflict areas, known as blood diamonds. This in turn should lead to the transparency and ethical sourcing of diamonds that the industry sorely needs.\nSecondly, the project seeks to find the value balance between the physical real-world asset, and the virtual-world twin in the form of its paired NFT.\nThe market, in the form of the Diamond Dawn collectors, will decide whether to own the physical diamond, or its digital representation. How many of the 333 NFTs will need to be burned before the value of the NFT becomes akin to that of the physical diamond? Which one will end up being worth more?\nFurther information\nThe Diamond Dawn project is only available through a submission process on the official website. If accepted as a collector, an individual is then given two invitations which they can share with other potential collectors. This keeps the process fair, and allows the public to form the collector community rather than the project team itself. There is a limit of two NFTs per collector.\nThose wishing to find out more about Diamond Dawn can also watch a short introductory video of the project on the Diamond Dawn Twitter account.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, saw an approximately 82% retracement from peak to trough thus far.\nAs you move down the ranks of cryptocurrencies, the total drawdown figures deepen. Cardano, for example, suffered a 92% collapse compared to the top two cryptocurrencies. Solana, once pegged to disrupt Ethereum, dropped by a staggering 96%.\nIn a new video entitled “Looking at Opportunities for the Next Crypto Bull Market,” Elliott Wave International Currency & Crypto Analyst Jason Soni touches on why – theoretically – this discrepancy exists.\nAccording to Soni, newer altcoins in their first cycle will see the deepest retracement. As cryptocurrencies mature, and go through more boom and bust cycles, retracements are less steep, like we’ve seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nETH 2018 versus ADA 2022 | ETHUSD on TradingView.com\nBitcoin Sets The Standard For Bear Market Corrections\nIn the video, Jason Soni used a comparison between many newer altcoins today following a similar trajectory and total drawdown as 2018 Ethereum. With each new cycle, new participants join and liquidity in each asset increases, reducing volatility over time and resulting in less and less in terms of max drawdown.\nThis is perhaps the most visible with Bitcoin. Following Bitcoin’s first major bull market, the first ever crypto asset retraced by 96%. In the second bear market ever in crypto, BTC retraced by 86%. During the 2018 bear market, Bitcoin sank by a grand total of 84%. A softer landing yet might still be possible during this bear market.\nConsidering the severity of the drawdowns in most cryptocurrencies and the extreme negative sentiment, it could mean that the end of the bear market is near.

Former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and former FTX CTO Gary Wang entered guilty plea deals with the U.S. government.\nThese individuals cooperate with law enforcement agencies and could provide evidence to convict SBF if he decides to proceed with the trial.\nIn addition to the plea, the court hearing determined that the people that helped Sam Bankman Fried to raise the money for the $250 million bond will remain a secrete at the request of the FTX founder.\nSBF asks judge to redact the names of the two individuals who co-signed his bond Who could it be? pic.twitter.com/yp2ZvKLQ2d — db (@tier10k) January 3, 2023\nAccording to a court document, the U.S. government did not fight the injunction granted by the court.\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,700 with sideways movement on the daily chart."}, {"date": "2023-01-03 19:49:48", "entity": ["lamportdao", "solana builders", "degods", "famous fox federation", "bonk", "nft", "solana", "bonk", "ftx", "sol", "sol", "ftx", "ftx", "solana", "bonk", "sol", "coingecko", "ftx", "solana", "solana", "sol", "solana", "coingecko", "solana", "solana", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "solana", "coingecko", "sol", "solana", "solana", "bonk", "dogecoin", "bonk", "solana"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "You can tell that things have really changed in the Solana space when a price around $13 is seen by investors and supporters as a cause for celebration.

Earlier this morning, Solana hit $13.21, but has come down slightly since that seven-day peak.\nAD\nAD\nMuch of the chatter and hype in the Solana ecosystem over the last days has focused on the rise of BONK, a Solana-based token with the same kind of “doge meme” theme as Dogecoin (DOGE) and the Ethereum-based token Shiba Inu (SHIB).\nBONK launched in late December with a large-scale airdrop, with free tokens sent to the wallets of a wide array of Solana developers and NFT collectors. This included developers that joined LamportDAO, a hub for Solana builders, as well as owners of NFTs from projects including DeGods and Famous Fox Federation.\nOverall, 100 trillion BONK tokens have been minted.

Projects are building with BONK and integrating the token, and the growing use and excitement appears to be fueling a surge in both BONK’s price and SOL’s own value.\nBONK is up 58% over the past 24 hours to a current price of $0.00000105, according to CoinGecko, with nearly $20 million in trading volume over the span and a market cap of almost $58 million. Earlier this morning, BONK showed a more than 100% day-over-day rise as the coin’s price kept surging, but the momentum has softened since.\nIt’s arguably the brightest sign that the Solana market has seen in the last two months, since the early November collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX torpedoed SOL’s price and dampened enthusiasm in the space.\nSOL traded for as much as $37 just before FTX’s liquidity crisis, and FTX’s close ties to Solana apparently crashed its price harder than other leading cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Solana fell out of CoinGecko’s top 10 coins by market cap and briefly crashed out of the top 20 last week as the price neared $8 for the first time in nearly two years.\nAD\nAD\nEven amid this week’s price rise, SOL is still down 95% from its all-time high of $260 set in November 2021. Solana surged in value in late 2021, but fell sharply last year amid wider crypto market struggles, technical issues, and eventually the added impact of the FTX downfall.\nSolana creators and developers are currently rallying around BONK, but meme coins and tokens are famously volatile and their surges can be short-lived."}, {"date": "2023-01-03 19:45:00", "entity": ["central bank", "bank of russia", "cbdc", "parliament", "central banks deputy minister of finance", "alexei moiseev", "russian federation", "state duma", "parliament", "central bank digital currency", "cbdc", "bank of russia", "bank of russia"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Russian Federation has submitted a draft bill regarding the digital ruble to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament.\nRussian lawmakers, led by the Chairman of the Financial Market Committee Anatoly Aksakov, have presented draft legislation on the central bank digital currency (CBDC) minted by Russia’s monetary authority – the digital ruble.

Many do not appreciate it and are trying to stay out of the spotlight.”\nJust before Christmas, Bankman-Fried was released from federal custody in Manhattan on a historic $250 million bond. The former crypto executive—-who was arrested a week prior on eight charges including conspiracy to commit fraud, money laundering, and violation of federal campaign finance laws—did not have to pay a dime to be released to his parents’ Palo Alto home.

A selloff in the exchange’s FTT token shook consumer confidence in FTX and led to a bank run on the exchange. The rush of customer withdrawals created a liquidity crunch that forced the company to admit it did not hold one-to-one reserves of client assets, ultimately causing the exchange to disable withdrawals before filing for bankruptcy.\nSBF kept his head bowed and eyes forward until the proceeding began, glancing to his side from time to time.

Our parent company, Miner US Limited, put on a great party for us to celebrate the launch. Miner US plans to provide an alternative to the usual risks and limitations associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, decentralized finance projects, crypto securities, and blockchain technology. Ethical cryptocurrency and blockchain investment is a top priority for this team of analysts, engineers, data scientists, operators, and risk managers. Managing resources wisely is a top priority for the organization.\nModels for Cloud Mining\nThe responses to the question \"How does cloud mining work?\" highlight cloud crypto mining models. Cloud-based cryptocurrency miners can choose between two distinct models. Two models of cloud-based crypto mining are described here.\nHashPowerLeasing\nIn this model, cloud miners lease a portion of a mining farm's hashing power. To participate in the mining farm's profits, miners must subscribe to a cloud mining company plan. Miners leasing hash power from the farm pay neither setup nor maintenance fees. The mining rewards of each miner are also determined by the hashing power of each miner.\nCloud mining benefits\nCloud mining's benefits must also be mentioned. Cloud-based cryptocurrency mining is efficient and maintenance-free. Cloud mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies offers numerous benefits.\nCost-effectiveness\nMining in the cloud is cost-effective because miners do not require equipment. Also, miners are not required to upgrade or maintain equipment. Miners need not be concerned with electricity costs, heat and noise from mining equipment.\nTrouble-free\nThe biggest benefit of cloud mining is that it is maintenance-free. Mining service companies maintain miners' equipment. Typically, mining service providers avoid maintenance problems by situating mining farms in cooler climates and utilizing chilling towers.\nSupport\nConsider the technological support provided by the mining service provider. Cloud-based cryptocurrency mining requires no cryptocurrency, mining hardware, or protocol expertise. Create an account with a mining service provider and pay the hashing power fees. All account rewards can be viewed on a tablet or smartphone.\nMiner US Launch and Services\nMiner US offers lifetime cloud mining for cryptocurrencies based on USDT. They provide multi-algorithm, multi-coin cloud mining by utilizing cutting-edge technology. Since its inception, the company's open hash power market has been a tremendous success. Mobile apps enable users to access our services from any location.\nUpon enrollment, new users earn 10 USDT in hashing power. As indicated in the table below, Miner US provides 150 days and exclusive lifetime mining power plans with a wide range of hash rate power.\nVIP 1 Hashrates(GH/s) (0.00~999.99USDT) Daily earning (2.50%)\nVIP 2 Hashrates(GH/s) (1000.00~9999.99USDT) Daily earning (3.00%)\nVIP 3 Hashrates(GH/s) (10000.00~29999.99USDT) Daily earning (4.00%)\nVIP 4 Hashrates(GH/s) (30000.00~99999.99USDT) Daily earning (5.00%)\nVIP 5 Hashrates(GH/s) (100000.00~499999.99USDT) Daily earning (6.00%)\nSVIP Hashrates(GH/s) (500000.00~599999.99USDT) Daily earning (10.00%)\nAfter the completion of the contract duration, the remaining balance can be fully withdrawn along with the principal amount.\nMiner US Referral Programs\nA user can invite a friend to join by giving them a unique code or a link to the sign-up page.

The construction of such a framework will be lengthy but also essential.\nAdditionally, the central government of Morocco had gotten in touch with the central banks of France, Sweden, and Switzerland to research the regulatory situations of these countries, which have previously had experience with digital assets.\nThrough this regulation, the governor stated that the law would help establish a definition for crypto relevant to Morocco. With the help of crypto regulation, the legislation intends to bring about more innovation without slowing down the industry’s growth.\nThe predominant reason behind introducing such a regulatory structure is to ensure that customers are safeguarded from this market’s extreme volatility.\nMorocco Is One Of The Fastest Growing Crypto Market In North-Africa\nAccording to a report from Chainalysis, it has been revealed that the crypto market has been growing at a substantial rate in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

In its filing, the SEC noted that FTT has a buy-and-burn program similar to a stock buyback, and they both result in increasing the asset’s value. Interestingly, Binance also has a similar program called BNB Burn, and investors wonder what will happen to their investments if the SEC initiates legal actions against Binance (BNB) as well.\nAlthough Binance CEO, Changpeng Zhao, has asserted that BNB is more than just a security, he has not been able to convince investors who are considering leaving the project. Consequently, Binance (BNB) has witnessed a sharp decline of 17% in its value in the last few weeks. Currently, Binance (BNB) is being traded at $244.79, which is 65% below its all-time high of $690.93.

Data from CoinWarz shows that it had fallen almost 3.6% in a sharp downward correction. This took the mining difficulty from the 35.36T that it was trending at to 34.09T following the adjustment.\nThe bitcoin mining difficulty is important in the fact that it actually measures how much power is needed to verify transaction blocks on the network. The higher this figure is, the more demand it shows for the bitcoin network. And the lower it becomes, it means there are fewer miners on the network.\nOne factor that has had a profound effect on the mining difficulty in the last month was the blizzard that blew through the United States. As temperatures dropped dangerously low in some places, miners had to disconnect their machines to free up the energy grid. This was in a bid to leave enough energy for citizens to power their homes.\nBTC price at $16,700 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\nImpact Of This On BTC\nThe bitcoin price is still stalling despite the sharp downward correction in the mining difficulty. The digital asset is still trending in the mid-$16,000s and has refused to budge. Even the return of some momentum with the new year has not been enough to trigger a movement beyond this point.\nSo when looking at the broader picture with the difficulty adjustment and price, it does not look like there would be any profound effect on price. Also, miners are still seeing similar profitability in their mining operations, so there is no tipping of the scale toward sell-offs or holding.\nAs long as the price continues to hold up above the $16,600 level, there should be no downtrend in price. Although if it does break below this support, then $16,000 is more likely than $17,000 in the short term. Also, add in the fact that there are multiple events such as the DCG and Gemini debacle unfolding over the next month, and it becomes imperative for the cryptocurrency to hold support.\nBitcoin was changing hands at a price of $16,700 at the time of this writing. It remains the largest cryptocurrency in the sector with a market cap of $322 billion.\nFeatured image from CoinDesk, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 17:00:04", "entity": ["genesis", "dcg", "grayscale", "bitcoin trust", "grayscale", "grayscale", "bitcoin trust", "gbtc", "genesis", "coinbase", "btc", "genesis", "gbtc", "dcg", "dcg", "gbtc", "bitcoin trust", "dcg", "coincu news", "tradingview", "grayscale", "bitcoin trust", "tradingview", "genesis", "gemini", "gemini", "earn", "gemini", "winklevoss brothers", "gemini", "genesis", "genesis", "dcg", "dcg", "genesis", "grayscale", "bitcoin trust", "digital currency group", "genesis", "grayscale", "genesis", "bitcoinist", "3ac", "dcg", "ftx", "dcg", "genesis", "luna", "genesis", "dcg"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The DCG and Genesis debacle continue to wax strong and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has taken some of the heat from this. The majority of the concerns have been raised around the ability of Digital Currency Group to be able to repay its debt to Genesis, which owes creditors a significant amount of money. Now, co-founder of bankrupt crypto hedge fund 3AC Su Zhu has joined the conversation and his predictions could adversely impact Grayscale.\nZhu Expects Genesis To File For Bankruptcy\nAs reported by Bitcoinist on Tuesday, 3AC co-founder and CEO Su Zhu published a Twitter thread detailing his take on the DCG drama. He explains that FTX and DCG, the parent company of Genesis, had conspired to attack LUNA, whose decline would eventually lead to the crash of his own hedge fund.\nHe accused the company of doing the “hard questions” and that they allegedly continued to take deposits from investors for another six months even though they knew they were insolvent. But the most notable of the Twitter thread was that he expects the crypto lender Genesis to file for bankruptcy.\nSu Zhu says that creditors would push the company to bankruptcy to take over the remaining DCG bankruptcy, which is a possibility. However, the implication of this would transcend just Genesis as DCG is the parent company of Grayscale, which runs the largest bitcoin trust in the world.\nIs Grayscale Caught In The Crossfire?\nOver the last few weeks, there has been concern over the health of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) since the news of the Genesis insolvency became public. So far, the fund has been able to hold up and Coinbase confirmed that it holds over 600,000 BTC in its custody service. But the question remains, what happens if Genesis were to file for bankruptcy?\nGBTC share price at $8.29 | Source: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust on TradingView.com\nGenesis reportedly owes Gemini over $900 million which belongs to the users of Gemini Earn, a yield-earning program on the exchange. Now, Gemini users are already clamoring for their funds and a lawsuit has been filed against the Winklevoss brothers already. So for Gemini to be able to get back its user funds which were given to Genesis, it may have to force the crypto lender into bankruptcy.\nIf Genesis files for bankruptcy, it would have to liquidate DCG assets, which reportedly owes the crypto lender over $1.6 billion, although CEO of DCG Barry Silbert has denied this. Nevertheless, the liquidation of DCG assets would affect the GBTC because it would also have to liquidate its position in the bitcoin trust. Given that DCG is a large investor in the fund, it could deepen the already wide discount to NAV that the trust is currently trading at.\nHowever, all of this remains speculation at this point. It remains a waiting game to see how all of this unfolds but it shows that the crypto market has another interesting year ahead of it.\nFeatured image from Coincu News, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 16:30:22", "entity": ["shiba", "shibarium", "eth whales", "shib", "shibarium", "shiba", "kusama", "shib", "shibarium", "shibarium", "shibarium", "shib", "unificationund", "shibarium", "shibarium", "shibarium", "shib", "shibarium", "eth wha", "shib", "shibarium", "shib", "shibburn", "shib", "trading shib"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "On the same day Shiba Inu founder Shytoshi Kusama tweeted (December 29) about Shibarium, ETH whales accumulated SHIB, and putting the crypto in the top 10 ranking of the most held token among 2,000 whales in the last 24 hours.\nThe launch of Shibarium, the upcoming L2 scaling solution for the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has been teased by Kusama, and many are wondering what this could bring on the table for SHIB in terms of price improvement.\nImage: Watcher Guru\nETH Whales: Shibarium And What It Means For SHIB\nThe L2 upgrade has been in development for some time already as the community-run ecosystem distances itself from its memecoin origins. The close implementation of Shibarium brings the SHIB community closer to this goal.\nLove meeting with the team from @UnificationUND about #Shibarium. Aligning. Onboarding. Finalizing. Soon. Very soon. — Shytoshi Kusama™ (@ShytoshiKusama) December 29, 2022\nThe main gist of Shibarium is to provide the Shiba Inu community a robust ecosystem for them to participate in. It promises utility, better throughput, and metaverse developments, not to mention games. Being deflationary, the burning of the token is a crucial part of Shibarium’s well-being.\nIn the past 24 hours, there have been a total of 182,339,090 $SHIB tokens burned and 11 transactions. Visit https://t.co/t0eRMnyZel to view the overall total of #SHIB tokens burned, circulating supply, and more. #shibarmy — Shibburn (@shibburn) January 3, 2023\nBut even though ETH whales have accumulated SHIB ahead of Shibarium’s launch, the token has not experienced any meaningful gains in the past 24 hours. It even slipped by 0.7% compared to BONE, the governance token of the upcoming Shibarium upgrade, which pumped over 5.6% since yesterday.\nWhat Can Happen On Shibarium Launch Day\nAs launch day nears, SHIB might lag behind BONE in terms of short-term price growth. This is because BONE is Shibarium’s governance token, giving its holders rights to vote on where the ecosystem should go.\nLong-term, however, the role of ETH whales and the burning of SHIB might have a significant effect on its price. According to Shibburn, the official burn tracker of the token, 182,339,090 SHIB has been burnt just today.\nSHIB total market cap at $4.4 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com\nOn ETH Whales Activity And Hype Build-Up\nThe previous ETH whales activity also affected the burn rate of SHIB. In the past few days until today, a total of 322,781,348 SHIB that was burned can be attributed to whale activity. However, this presents a strong problem as a drop in price after whale accumulation means that retail investors are not participating in the market.\nThe reason for the non-participation in the crypto market is that they face a worsening economic situation. Retail investors might also be migrating their capital to safer assets that can hedge them from inflation like government bonds.\nMeanwhile, investors and traders should be careful of the hype build-up. This hype builds speculative pressure on SHIB with a possible sell-off as Shibarium releases and the token reaches its peak price.\nFor short-term gain, a break above $0.00000826 price resistance will bring gains for investors and traders.\n-Featured image: VOI"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 16:03:31", "entity": ["satoshi", "satoshi", "satoshi"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Again, Satoshi never explained this.

The relevant indicator here is the “Network Value to Transaction” (NVT) ratio, which measures the ratio between the market cap of any crypto and its transaction activity.\nUsually, the trading volume is considered as the transaction activity of a coin, but Santiment’s NVT ratio works differently. Instead of dividing the market cap by the volumes, this version of the metric makes use of the “daily circulation,” a measure of the total number of unique coins that have seen some movement in the past day.\nThe advantage of the circulation indicator is that transactions, where the same coins jump through several wallets, are only counted once towards the measurement, while the normal trading volume metric would have counted them as many times as they were transferred. This helps eliminate duplicate transactions and gives a more accurate idea about the market activity.\nNow, what the NVT ratio tells us is how the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum currently compares against the activity on the respective networks. High values of the metric suggest the volumes are much lower than the cap right now, and hence the coin may be overvalued at the moment. On the other hand, low values suggest the price may be undervalued.\nNow, here is a chart that shows where the NVT ratio has been valuing Bitcoin and Ethereum during the past few years:\nThe value of the metric seems to have been bearish for both the coins recently | Source: Santiment\nAs the above graph shows, the NVT ratio has been bearish for Bitcoin since August 2022. This means that in the last few months, the circulation on the BTC network has remained pretty low when compared to the market cap of the crypto.\nFor Ethereum, the indicator’s value had been switching between bearish and bullish throughout 2022, but the coin seems to have ended the year being overvalued as the circulation was bearish in December.\nIf the cryptos continue to be overvalued according to the NVT, then a correction may be imminent for them. “The circulation rate of both networks need to pick up in 2023, and this week will be telling as non-holiday days begin,” explains Santiment.\nBTC Price\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16,700, down 1% in the last week.\nLooks like BTC has surged in the last couple of days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from mana5280 on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 15:29:12", "entity": ["eth", "gbtc", "grayscale", "grayscale", "bitcoin trust", "gbtc", "gbtc", "bitcoin", "dcg", "grayscale", "grayscale", "gbtc", "grayscale", "sec", "grayscale", "digital currency group", "dcg", "bitvavo", "dcg", "dcg", "grayscale ethereum trust", "ethe", "ethereum", "ychar", "eth", "ethereum", "grayscale capital"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) now trades at a record 59.39% discount relative to the price of Ethereum (ETH), per data from YCharts.\nThough at one point the fund actually traded at a significant premium relative to ETH, it has continuously been at a discount compared to market prices since November 2021.\nAD\nAD\nETHE allows traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without investing in the cryptocurrency themselves and is managed by Grayscale Capital, one of the crypto world’s largest institutional investors.\nThe fund, which has roughly $3.6 billion in assets under management (AUM), has lost roughly 68.37% of its value this year to date, as ETH and other crypto assets have declined more broadly.\nGBTC trades near record discount\nGrayscale’s sister fund, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), is facing similar issues.\nPer YCharts, shares in GBTC are currently trading at a 45.17% discount relative to the price of Bitcoin, slightly up from its record discount of 48.89% recorded in mid-December.

We’re buzzin as always, today we're coming in hot from the West Coast. Well, I'm still on the East Coast and tomorrow, but our guest is buzzing from the West Coast coming in hot from San Fran beautiful SF. Today we have Bradley Kam, also known as Brad, who's the co-founder of Unstoppable Domains, a Web3 Domain Name Provider working to onboard the world onto Web3. Prior to Unstoppable Domains, he co-founded Talkable, a marketing tech company backed by Y Combinator, we always love to see that Brad also holds a BA in Poli Sci from Emory University. Super pumped to have you on Brad, welcome to the show, man.\nBrad Kam\nThanks so much for having me.\nMatt Zahab\nWhat’s San Fran like nowadays, how's San Fran treating everyone?\nBrad Kam\nYou know, it's quiet. It's quieter than it used to be. But it's nice, like startup community still here Crypto Community is still here. It's just most of the parties are somewhere else.\nMatt Zahab\nThe crazy Exodus. I've talked about this so many times in the show, it's still intrigues me so much. So is the bus still there's the startup buzz, can you still feel it in the air?\nBrad Kam\nYou can a bit, you know, I think that it's so like the startup founders were there. But then the rest of the teams aren't there anymore. Everybody else. So like you don't see it as much like of it's kind of invisible. You don't see like kids walking around with bark backpacks absolutely everywhere, or like, people talk about their startup at every coffee shop anymore, but they're still there. And the early-stage community is still there. And the Crypto Community is still there and for us, but I think it's split now with New York, which is, which is not the way that it used to be before COVID.\nMatt Zahab\nAnd you moved to San Fran, back in the day, if I did my prep correctly here. I want to say that was around 10 years ago in 2011. That's when you founded Talkable, which is sort of that, you know, referral marketing company, I believe back in the day from YC love here and any YC stories do you have any crazy stories from PG or any one of the like, or any of the classic, you know, move fast and break things like anything that really stuck out from your time at YC that you still use today at Unstoppable or anything of the like.\nBrad Kam\nSo yeah, so I lived in 2012, I had probably, I think one, one walk with a PG. That's what he used to do, he would take every team and then go on a 15 minute walk around Mountain View with you, and then take you back to the front and there'd be a line of teams behind you. And he dropped me off to pick up the next team. And during that 15-minute talk, he told us we had this idea about how we were going to is sort of related to being able to invest or like predict which companies that were using Talkable were going to be successful, we were kind of excited about this idea. And he goes, You guys aren't gonna care about this in a year. This sounds like a distraction; I would just focus on your core business. And he was right. So a couple minutes, a couple months later, we realized that it was really a distraction and not our core business. And then we went back to doing what we had intended to do, and it worked out. So just a good reminder that somebody who has experienced that as seeing the patterns. They know what a tangent looks like. And that's stuck with me a bit. I tried to reflect, you know, is this really the thing we set out to do or not? If it's not, like, you know, I think you need to really question whether or not it's the right thing, I hear all of this, like, pro pivot ideas kind of out there in the world. And I'm a little skeptical, like, I think, you know, it can work but, you know, there's a reason why you decided to do this crazy absurd thing with your life called Startup where it's like, it's like almost an irrational decision to just hyper focus on this one thing and like give up all these other parts of life. So to just throw that away for another thing. You know, I think that you might you might burn yourself out that way. So you know, usually there's something that inspired you to go work on a particular thing that's why I'm skeptical of a lot of pivots.\nMatt Zahab\nWell said it's true the whole pivot culture so front of mind and accepted nowadays where it's like if you don't think that your moral compass and North Star can work it's like yeah, just throw your hands in the air say fuck it and pivot and maybe the pivot will be the thing it's a little counterintuitive. What of that move by PG though like talk about you know, get into birds don't that once they're so like he gets the walk all day you got to get his steps and get his exercise perhaps his own to cardio while also providing that mentorship to all the YC companies like that's the biggest vet move I've ever heard. I'd love that.\nBrad Kam\nIt's a great life. I love my work allowed me to wander around every day like I would I would definitely do. I do a lot of walking meetings actually. Like whenever people ask me to go to call fit. I always wind up taking them on like a pretty serious cardio walk up and down hills and stuff like that because I'm just sitting all day. So if I'm gonna meet you in person, I don't want to go sit in a restaurant.\nMatt Zahab\nYeah, no, that's huge, especially in San Fran, you guys have good enough weather to do that. In Toronto, it’s a little tough. Do you have any, like, any workflows are procedures for your walking meetings, because that's something that I absolutely adore as well. I've gotten a lot of feedback for like, both positive and negative being like, Oh, wow, this is great. I'm gonna incorporate this into my own life and I've also gotten the you know, why do I need to go for a walk with you? Like why can't it just be face to face and it's like well, if we're going to do it just like you said, if we're gonna go have a cup of joe together we might as well have a cup of joe go for a walk, get 10,000 steps and over the case have been an hour and a half and you know, get to Bridgestone at once and the processes and procedures are needed to make the whole process a lot smoother on your end and there end.\nBrad Kam\nWell you're right so San Francisco weather is almost always nice. So you can do it pretty much any day of the year. But I go like super I guess lazy I go to a spot that's five minutes walk from my house. Sometimes I even suggest that people come and walk on my roof because I got a really nice roof where you can see the whole city now and it's legitimately a pot like a nice experience. Like it's a those two walks are I would consider that to be almost destinations on their own. So people tend to enjoy it. And yeah, I've got a 100% success rate so far. No complaints.\nMatt Zahab\nOkay, I'm gonna have to take notes, get my success rate up a little higher. Let's get into the you and crypto and more specifically you and Unstoppable Domains. While doing research for you in the show. I saw read heard whatever you want to call it. You read a WIRED article back in 2011. And this is what got you not hooked but intrigued and interested in Bitcoin. And the rest is history. Is that true?\nBrad Kam\nNo, not quite. I read the WIRED article, which I think a lot of people read in 2011 The Rise and Fall of Bitcoin. And then I said, Oh, that's cool. And that I said the magazine aside, I didn't think about it again for another 18 months. And then 18 months later, I moved to San Francisco in 2012. And I moved to this Hacker House called 20Mission in the Mission District in San Francisco and it was a Bitcoin hub. So there was a Bitcoin exchange that got launched in the basement. Before Coinbase there was a Bitcoin Media Channel that was running in 2013 they were doing meetups going back to 2012 the Talaq gave a talk in the courtyard before Ethereum went live. Basically everybody who was there was somehow involved in crypto. I, when I moved to the city, I knew one person and he lived in this house, it was a good friend of mine from Atlanta. And everybody I met was somehow involved in Bitcoin it was almost like the community I landed in the Bitcoin future was like the default future like people were just like, well, of course, and Bitcoin was, you know, sub a billion market cap at this time, like there was no reason to be so confident. But when you put yourself around a whole bunch of technologists, they see that future is inevitable. And so that's what I walked into. When I moved to San Francisco, I was very lucky. So I read the white paper around then sort of following it sort of buying soon after that sort of going into events, and etc. And, you know, was kind of following along in the background while working on my marketing tech company. And then a few years later, I just, I can no longer sit on the sidelines. So it was really just luck of being dropped into this group of people and many of them, you know, later went on to do something pretty awesome in the crypto space.\nMatt Zahab\nWhat's that famous quote, like three most important things in life who you marry, where you live, and I forget the third, I'm butchering it. It's something big. But anyways, that's number one with you, though, it's like, if you wouldn't have been in San Fran, back in 2012. When I believe you found out about it, like the perhaps you would have never known. You know, like, yeah, your circle.\nBrad Kam\nOr never paid attention. You know, I would have heard about it. Like I think a lot of people but I wouldn't have realized and no action. Yeah, I wouldn't realize the weight of it. Because you know, like, yeah, you read a news story and you're like, Okay, well, I don't know, you know, I don't know, maybe that's real, maybe that's not but when you're surrounded by people that really understand the tech and everybody was mining. Everybody was you know, buying everybody was you know, trying it out. People were building you know, Bitcoin hardware, wallets, you know, all sorts of stuff. So, it just, it made it feel real in a way that maybe it wouldn't have if I had been from a distance. So I really do believe this that like if you if you want to get into something, it's good to surround yourself with people who are deep in it. And you know, I think, you know, I hate to use the term insider, but I think that almost every industry has this kind of institutional knowledge and a lot of it is shared, you know, person to person or kind of collective on understandings after conversations and dinners and things like that. So I think it works that way with Hollywood. And with entertainment. I think it works that way with politics and DC. I think it works that way with finance in New York. So I think it's like there are these hubs for these industries. And, you know, San Francisco was the spot for crypto for probably almost the past decade.\nMatt Zahab\nVery well said such an underrated and extremely important part of life is where you are and who you surround yourself with. Let's jump a couple years and you moved to SF, you work on your marketing tech company, you and everyone else there loves Bitcoin, you are now an investor in a couple of companies in the space. And then your co-founder comes up with you for an idea about a consumer friendly Blockchain Domains/naming startup, too good of an opportunity for you to pass up on the rest of history. Five, six years later, 2022 You guys are biggest naming company in this space and have a vision to onboard billions of people to Web3. Before we get into it, I'd love if you could give me the quick pitch just to sort of set the foundation for Unstoppable Domains.\nBrad Kam\nYeah, well, so your Web3 Domains name is supposed to be your identity on the Internet, kind of like your username on the Internet. And the difference is that you own it, you own it forever, you control it. And this enables you to do things like control your own data, control your profile, control your reputation. It can work across all sorts of apps. It's kind of a paradigm shift for the way that the Internet works today. Your identity is controlled by social media companies or finance companies like PayPal, etc. And if you turn that around, and you put it in the hands of the people I think you get you get a much more powerful product and you get you get much more security, autonomy, freedom.\nMatt Zahab\nWhen you guys started UD Unstoppable Domains to me, and I'm pulling this is strictly, you know, this is hogwash, this fake news, I'm about to say, hey, maybe it's not but this is I have no merit or no stats or data based on this. The biggest problem when I onboard friends to crypto is the, you know, X character, whatever, let's say it's ETH 20, whatever 26 character, whatever the case may be, I'm sitting sometimes 40 characters hexadecimal address. It's like, Hey, Brad, you owe me 100 bucks, and I send you 0x, one bubble, blah, blah, blah. That's absolutely nonsensical. They see that and then they go, okay, Matt, what if I add an extra letter number, you're hooked? It's going to the best. That seems like the no brainer for why even the team started Unstoppable Domains, perhaps right? Perhaps it's not, we'll find out. And now it just seems so apparent that the whole data play seems like a bigger, more important, humans are now cognizant of how much Web2 has taken our data harvested, it profited off of it given none of it back to us. In return, we only got the usability and the nice UI and UX of these big behemoth Fortune 500 Web2 companies, am I right? Not in regards to it starting off with like the shitshow of the letters and numbers and making it easy like “brad.nft”, or “brad.crypto”. And now present day, it's about the data play?\nBrad Kam\nYeah, totally. Right. So when we started, I mean, I would say going back to 2014, there was this assumption in Bitcoin meetups, that you would go around and you talk to people, people would just assume that the long characters were eventually going to be hidden, like they would like people would talk about it in terms of lectures, this thing is never going to go mainstream. Until you know, we have some sort of User Name System, people weren't designing one or sure what exactly what it was gonna look like, or how it was going to work or anything like that. But there was kind of this default of, it's only going to be for enthusiast until we have easy to use names. So I remember talking with Matt, my co-founder about this general idea, probably back in 2014, I think it was. So that was just an assumption that we had hanging out with crypto people at that time. And fast forward to 2016, 2017, when Ethereum came out, and you started to see all of these, they didn't call them this yet, but NFT apps coming out, then we realized, Hey, this is a format that we could use to build Web3 Domains names. And that was the starting point. And we had this vague idea that the Internet is broken. And this tech should also be at a very basic level, if you have a private key. If you have a public private key pair, then you can put your user in charge of their own security. And so we knew that was true. And we thought that would make a better Internet. And so we always thought, we're going to start with crypto, then we're going to make the Internet better by giving every user a public private key pair with you know, through their Domain name, and that's going to make the Internet better. What we didn't I think, appreciate the beginning was how totally screwed the regular Internet was and at, to say, 2017 time when this idea was first getting baked, I don't think that was quite so obvious yet. You know, I mean, I think it was starting to peak, there was like a little bit of Facebook anger over the 2016 election stuff. And so it was kind of it was starting, but it was not very early. Yeah, like now. And, here's another random, you know, random quirk of history, free speech was a liberal cause at that time, it was the people that were talking about free speech, were saying, like Hong Kong, protesters need to be freed. And all of these things, it was not a domestic issue at all, it was not a conservative issue at all.\nMatt Zahab\nFive years ago, we're talking.\nBrad Kam\nYeah, very, recent. So the world has changed a lot in the way that people view these problems. And then, you know, things just kind of exploded, somewhere around 2018 time, or all of a sudden, everyone in the world realized, hey, the Internet is just totally screwed. Like social media companies control everything, they're able to decide who gets to say what they're making all this money off of our data, like, well, we saw a study pretty recently saying that there's a, your data on average gets sold 1000 times per day, so per person, 1000 times per day, which is just a, I mean, it's just an outrageous economy. Where, yeah, where we are the cattle essentially being sold. It, we've no idea, and all of that, I think is just kind of blasted into the mainstream, very recently. You know, there's, you know, Netflix movies, you know, the social dilemma, etcetera. And the funny thing about all of that is they say, okay, the Internet is broken, it's bad. And then that it kind of gets to the end. And they're like, and we have no idea what to do about it. So tell your kids to turn off their phones. Like, that's the solution that we get to. And Web3 has a solution. You know, it's I think it's gonna take a while to play out. But there's actually a way to do this better. And it all comes down to put user in control. And that's how you get security and safety and autonomy.\nMatt Zahab\nRight? You can't stop there. You got to keep going. How do you put the user in control that was gold to keep the trains?\nBrad Kam\nYeah, that's super. So the starting point is the Domains name, which is your username. And so I have brad.crypto, that is my like universal username across apps. So you can send me money to it in dozens of different crypto wallets and exchanges, I can log into dApps using it. And I have this digital profile. It's kind of like a social media profile page, I control the data. The only way you can access it is if I sign a message with the private key that controls the Domain name. And then I'm able to log into dApps and have verified information about me. It's the equivalent of like, imagine that there was a new Facebook that came out. And instead of having to go and upload your photos, and connect with your friends, and build content, and spend two years building up your profile, just with two clicks, all of your previous activity that you wanted to come along with comes a lot.\nMatt Zahab\nIt's like when you get a new iPhone, and you just put your old one beside the new one. And it automatically syncs everything. That's like the biggest treat ever to me. I cannot believe how smooth that is. The best.\nBrad Kam\nExactly. And now imagine that that is every app on the Internet.\nMatt Zahab\nHuge.\nBrad Kam\nAnd so a new app comes about. And people think like, Okay, well, you know, why is that so important? The reason it's so important is competition leads to better user experiences, like so we don't have competition right now. We have Facebook, and they are our app, and they are our data storage, and giving them the data storage role. That's the thing that messed us up. And that's the thing that Unstoppable wants to change. So if they're no longer your data store, if they're just an app, then they're no longer in a position to control you. Instead, they have to work for your love. They have to give you an amazing experience. Because if they don't, two clicks, and you're going to a competitor, yeah, there could be 100 Facebook's and they could all pop up all the time. But there's almost no new social media apps that compete directly with the old ones. They build new features sometimes, but they almost never compete with the old ones. Initially, because the data storage piece, the data storage piece is just such a monopoly that users can't get out users are stuck. And that I think is the real promise of have a Web3 Identity System is it's just trivial for me to move around on the Internet. So that's, that's one thing, the flexibility. I think the other thing and this part is really not well understood, unless you look at the revenues of some of these giant companies, but your data is worth a lot. Somebody is making lots of money off of this. And what's going to happen if you control your identity is you make that money. You make that well. People will literally, they pay you for proving certain information about yourself, they might pay you in cash, they might pay you in rewards, like an app gives you a special reward because of who you are and what your reputation is. But ultimately, that wealth is going to go to you, instead of going to all of these big ad providers, I think, that's the other really big piece, you're gonna get competition. And then you're going to actually be able to keep and build wealth. From the things you do online.\nMatt Zahab\nI think the last part, you talked about how the consumer can own and profit, monetize their data, I think that's huge. Because you know, life is all about incentives, and the users gonna want like, Hey, Brad, if I'm gonna sign up on Unstoppable and get a “matt.crypto”, which I assume your co-founder has, by the way, yeah, I'm sure he does. One of the, you know, Mom, Dad, I love you guys, but perhaps maybe picked a more unique name than Matthew, but say that story for another day. The data, that's the point where it's like now that you guys are letting users know that in a couple years, they will have 100% rights, and there will be a multitude of ways to profit off their own data. That's a big one a value/slash incentive to get people in the door. But until then, right now, there's really not that big of value prop, right now, the sort of the workflow and in transactional system is, I give you my data. And in return, I get to use a really solid app that all of my peers also use, you know what I mean? Like, there's no real big value profit, it's going to happen, what three to five years, most likely.\nBrad Kam\nI hoped sooner, I think you're gonna start to see some things in 2023, I think you're gonna start to see some, you know, rewards and things like that. In 2023, inside of the Unstoppable Ecosystem, there's already some very basic things like, you can get a free Domain inside of a low value free Domain has a certain apps, if you log in and share certain data. So there's already Unstoppables, already offering a reward, I think other apps are going to start offering rewards. And that's going to be kind of the form it takes, is, you know, rather than, you know, somebody says, Hey, will you sell me every personal piece of information about you for $30 per month, which is kind of like closer to Facebook, it's going to be more like, Hey, you are a user who is DeFi DEGEN. And you also have a pretty decent social media following. So we want to give you this product for free, or we want to give you this product, and we want you to try out this product, and we want to give you this sort of a discount. So I think it's going to feel closer to like marketing actually is going to be the way that users experience it. But that's still money being transferred to the user instead of money being transferred to this third party. And I think that's the real big shift that a Web3 identity is going to lead to.\nMatt Zahab\nSuch an interesting point there. What's the Domains on Unstoppable right now are the most sought after, would it be ENS which is “.eth” for those at home.\nBrad Kam\nSo on Unstoppable side, the ones that are selling the best are I believe “.crypto” has actually the most registrations, and then I think “.nft” is a close second. In terms of dollars, “.x” is also pretty high up there “.x” is more expensive. That's kind of the more kind of premium but in terms of number of registrations, I believe “.crypto” and then “.nft” is running quickly behind it.\nMatt Zahab\nThat's huge and on the setup side just for the folks at home. If I want to get mistaken let's say I'm a full name mattzahab.crypto and then again I take you to dinner we go get a couple of stakes, it's 500 bucks after maybe some steaks and some red vino and I pull a shit guy move and go Brad, you owe me you know you're paying for dinner tonight I want 500 bucks in any crypto from the user side of things, how easy is it to get all my addresses from whether it's Metamask, Centralized Exchange, blah, blah, blah, maybe not Centralized Exchange, but take your coins off no keys, not your coins, set up a ledger or a Trezor or any cold wallet, get those addresses, connect it with your username/Domain on Unstoppable Domains, walk me through the process of how to get locked and loaded from the consumer standpoint.\nBrad Kam\nSo we'll make it pretty easy for you, especially with Ethereum and Polygon Addresses. So we'll make it so you can apart when you meant the Domains that those are auto attached because you know we can we can easily pull that information. And so those can kind of seamlessly attach then you do have to go back in and add others there's some setups we have where a crypto wallet will allow you to just attach essentially all your addresses at once if you want to like a Bitcoin, ETH, Litecoin whatever. But generally the flow is ETH Polygon will auto attach and then you'll copy and paste your Bitcoin address one time, attach it to your Domain name and then you're good.\nMatt Zahab\nAnd that's it. Otherwise you're good to go.\nBrad Kam\nYes, copy and paste and then press one button. The good news is that you get to verify it once you verify find that one time, then after that when a user goes to pay you with their Domain name, you know that you type in the Domain name. And it'll show a little checkmark like, yes, there is a valid Bitcoin address associated with this Domain name. If not, you can't send. So it's not like you can like, accidentally, like you have to type in the Domain name wrong. And that has to be a valid Domain name in order to send to the wrong person. And it's just a lot easier to check a human readable name. I mean, this is just, you know, the machines are great for it. The machines are great. And they can handle 40 characters. Humans can't because we just our eyes cannot fat cannot check all of those random characters. So we need order, you know, we need words that make sense to us. And that's why name is important. And the shorter the name, in some ways, the better because the easier to make sure that it’s the right person.\nMatt Zahab\nWell, the whole crypto Domain saga and revolution, and momentum is sort of mimicked and almost copied the traditional Web2 Domain right where it was like, you want generic, broad keywords that can be used for you know, like Mark Cuban sold a bunch of really good Domain, you have your I don't know I'm looking at it, you have your “arena.eth”, you know, your “beer.eth”, “flicker.eth”, whatever, right? All your very popular ones. And on top of that you have the shorter, the better. And then we had the whole ENS revolution. I guess that was back, I want to say early this year. And it wasn't even so much names. It was the numbers. What did you make of the whole numbers thing? I guess I'll give some context. First, there was a whole digits for ENS. Right? So it started off in people who got three digits, so like 001, double seven went for, I think 100 grand, then you had your you know, “123.eth”, and then you had your four digits. So “8912.eth”, these were all worth a lot of money. I think four digits are still worth like 10 grand for random numbers, “.eth”? What's your whole take on that you think that's here to stay? Or was that just a fad, and it's gonna be toast in a couple of years.\nBrad Kam\nIt is hard to say ,with traditional Domains names, there is some value to number of Domains, especially internationally, a lot of a lot of number Domains wind up being brands and things. Yeah, so there is something to say about numbers. I think it's possible the Web3 it's very hard to say. But I do feel like it also moved into fad territory a bit. And that it's easier to group numbers like to say like a I'm a very introvert, everybody has a five, you know, five digit number Domain rather than grouping. Names, words and things like that, which may be might not fit into standard groups in quite the same way. But if you look at traditional Domains, you know, shorter names probably are better than shorter, and then the equivalent character number of numbers. So generally speaking, crypto Twitter loves fads. So we do, we do get a little and it lasted, you know, we saw it too, like there were like crazy numbers of number registrations on our site on several Domains as well. And it did burn out a bit after a couple of months. It may come back, but I suspect that there's a lot of other categories out there that are relevant to users so hard to say there was fun.\nMatt Zahab\nNo, it was it was a good rep. Folks. Quick break. Gotta give a huge shout out to our sponsor of the show that is PrimeXBT, we'd love PrimeXBT as we've been using for a hot minute. Why?

I'm going to put you on the put you in the hot seat. How the hell is GoDaddy not offered to buy you guys out yet? Or one of the big Domains name companies? Or perhaps they haven't. And I don't know about it. But any rumblings on that?\nBrad Kam\nI think this is a little bit the innovators dilemma, you know, and I think the real issue is that traditional Domain names are really tools for businesses to build their web presence. And so their market is really like small businesses up to big businesses. And our market, our end users are consumers building their digital identity. So they've got a couple 100 million potential users. We've got 4 billion you know the whole Internet, but we're not really focused on the website Use Case, we're focused on payments, and we're focused on identity. We're focused on login and authentication. So there's actually like not a ton of overlap today, between the customer bases and between what you're using with Domains. So they're not surprisingly, they're not actually the closest to what we're doing, I would say that the social media companies are actually getting a little bit closer, Twitter and Reddit, etc. So they're kind of the ones that are trying to go after sort of a similar market, and I'm sure you saw Reddit Avatars, yeah, that is a form of identity, you know, you would want to have a username, and you would want to have, you know, a digital profile picture, you know, which is kind of like what the avatars are. So they're working on a piece of, you know, kind of a future, you know, decentralized social media. So those are the companies that are probably a little bit closer, we'll see what the traditional Domains name companies do. I think that jumping from being a SMD PRODUCT, to being a consumer product is a really is a big leap. And that's actually why they have focused on it less, they are paying attention. And there is a awesome Domains name conference every year that we speak out called NamesCon. And we've been there since 2018 telling the community that this is going to be the future of Domains names. And, you know, they laughed at us in 2018, and 2019. And we're maybe like, a little bit curious in 2020, and 2021, and 2022. Everyone's like, Yeah, this is inevitable. Like, this definitely the future. So there's a lot of awareness now. And there's a lot of poking around that I think you're gonna start to see a lot of traditional Domains registrar's, get into the space in some way, in terms of, you know, selling Domains names, etc. So I think you're gonna see it, likely in 2023. But it's still a stretch for them, because it's a different customer base, they just need new products, because that industry is not.\nMatt Zahab\nThat's what I mean, though. And that's where doesn't make sense to acquire the leader in the space who's offering those new products to a brand-new subset of consumers. But again, you're right, it's a lot of the times the risk does not outweigh the reward.\nBrad Kam\nIf you make the right move for them, it's just, you know, it's just tough when you're the big incumbent, and you're sitting on this crazy, you know, crazy cash cow, you know, to say, like, you know, should I, you know, should I give it up, I missed this, I think is probably the same thing that's happening with like, you know, Google and all the AI chat stuff. Yeah. You know, like, I think there's a lot of people to Google that were like, hey, this AI chat stuff might kill us. We should do something about it. And somebody else says, Yeah, but money's falling from the sky over here. So like, do you really want to stop sky money? Like, in the meantime, I think that's a really, you know, I think it's a tough position to be at, you know, it's like a champagne problem that can kind of get you stuck.\nMatt Zahab\nI assume you've been fucking around with ChatGPT. And like, it's pretty much fun to create, any unique or under the table Use Cases that haven't been making the rounds on Twitter, or LinkedIn or Insta or anything like that.\nBrad Kam\nI don't feel like I'm the expert on this. So, I don't think I'm gonna have any unique insight. But there's, I think there's just a lot of writing that happens that is sort of, not in the so to speak, like creative category, that's in the kind of functional category. And, you know, I find myself doing it a lot, I find team members doing it a lot, I think that these tools can really just eliminate that, like supercharge that, and then we're gonna kind of get back to the sort of, you know, creative writing will be the thing, you know, creative ideation, I should say, will be the thing that we humans can contribute, and that a lot of the rest of the stuff, you know, mundane stuff, like, you know, let's just press a button, and you know, and crank it out. Like, that just seems great. Like, it's basically like the AI just figured out how to do all the boring writing for us. So that's the best part.\nMatt Zahab\nThe best part. Yeah, got of a weird one here for you. We'll get into some fun questions. You could own any Domain in the world. Cannot be a company and cannot be a name? So it can't be something like “tesla.eth” or, you know, or “saudiaramco.com” or whatever. But we'll go for crypto for the sake of ETH here, cannot be a first name and cannot be a company name. What generic keyword are you going for? For a “.com” or “.crypto”? What's Brad get a was he jumping up? Anything in the world?\nBrad Kam\nSo it's definitely gonna be a finance and probably crypto term. You know, I mean, I think Bitcoin would be up there. Yeah, you know, I think Pi would be up there. I think all these like, yeah, these like kind of generic finance terms I think would be would be really high up there. They'd probably be close to the top of the list. I don't know what the most popular first name is in the world. But whatever the globally most popular First name. That's probably interesting.\nMatt Zahab\nMuhammad. Yeah. Needs Muhammad by a landslide to. That'd be bananas. Next up for Unstoppable. What do you guys have on the dock? You guys, it seems like you guys have a new integration or partnership every single week, we'd love to see that keep the momentum going, especially in a bear market. But what do you guys have on top for 2023. And beyond?\nBrad Kam\nThat's a really big focus, because it's actually easier to do integrations during bear market, because the bull is busy, like during bull market, everyone's just trying to make sure that their website doesn't go down, because new users are showing up and ensemble had this problem to where like, it's hard to invest in longer term things when, you know, it's just crazy like that. And once we all get to kind of take a breather during bear market, and all of a sudden, you know, it's easier to do integration. So yeah, we're talking to all sorts of companies that, you know, maybe we wouldn't have been talking to, you know, nine months or a year ago. So that's a huge focus for us during the bear market, on the tech side, building out more tools for the digital profiles, and we want you to be able to really feel like this is kind of like the digital you that you're going to be able to add all sorts of information and continue to enrich your profile so that it's more useful in apps and dApps. So those are those are the two big areas.\nMatt Zahab\nAnd the end goal of Unstoppable is it literally to one onboard the masses to Web3, and to give everyone a platform where they can own, monetize and control their data.\nBrad Kam\nYeah, we want all 4 billion Internet users to be using Domains as their usernames controlling their own data and logging in on the Internet and paying and do all the things that they do today, but in a in a self-sovereign way.\nMatt Zahab\nI mean, you'd love to see that Brad what a treat man. It's been a lot of fun. Couple more rapid fire ones for you here. Why the name? It's such a good name. But why Unstoppable Domains? Like, it's unorthodox. You know, like most people literally don't pick the like, you guys are in the Domains game. And you chose to add Domains to it. Like, it's unique. It's unorthodox. But it hits so nice. Like, yeah, why do you name it that?\nBrad Kam\nYou know, I mean, we were we were playing around with names. And we, you know, we came across this concept of like, what is really unique about this technology, I think the thing that's really unique about this technology is ownership. And we really wanted to and I would just say in general, I think Web3, the value of Web3 is really about ownership, that the user, the value of crypto, I think is really about ownership. I own my Bitcoin, I own my Ethereum and the same thing is true for your Web3 Domains name, the same thing is true for your NFT art, it's all comes down to this idea of ownership. And we wanted to highlight that we wanted that to be the thing that stuck in your head which is that I own this thing and so Unstoppable felt like a concept that like a powerful version of that concept. And I think that if we want to you know if I want to say like how do we want people to feel in this new Internet, I would say empowered, and that's why Unstoppable felt like the right term.\nMatt Zahab\nIt's good it's just it's like I said it's unique and it hits good shit there. Last question, hot take factory we're jumping in, put a shake kickin boots on and it's time for Brad to let us give us a couple hot takes and then only Brad believes in the most other people do not can be sports, food politics, space, AI, you name it. What are a couple of Brad hot takes must have a couple?\nBrad Kam\nLet's see. My only once per day. I think maybe already.\nMatt Zahab\nYou spoke with that. That's so cool. Folks, Brad eats one meal between six and 7pm. Just dinner, and the benefits just keeps you clear keeps your light focused all day long.\nBrad Kam\nYeah, I'm not convinced it's the healthiest. But it is the best for mental clarity for me. So I can just go throughout the day, I never feel tired. I just feel very energized and might I'm able to think clearly. You know, if I eat a big lunch or even a small lunch, then you know, sometimes I slow down for an hour. And I feel like I lost that time. So I just try to the save until the end of the day.\nMatt Zahab\nWhy do you feel like it might not be the healthiest for you?\nBrad Kam\nWell, I'm told that eating all at once later on in the day, like eating large amounts later on in the day might not be the best. So I'm still kind of playing around with played around with how to do it. I know this is best for mental, you know, mental clarity, but maybe it's not the best for say weight gain or something like that. And it's never been a problem. But I'm 39 now and I think you know, it gets a little harder over time. So may need to adjust a little bit but it's definitely worked for me for the past 15 years.\nMatt Zahab\nI feel like you're your gut and your energy Thank you for that as well like you shouldn't eating once a day you're really you're not working them that much. Are you a black coffee kind of guy throughout the morning and afternoon?\nBrad Kam\nA little bit a half and half so yeah, so I do get some I do get some calories through coffee in the morning.\nMatt Zahab\nLove that. Brad would a treat man really appreciate you coming on. You guys been one of my favorite consumer facing crypto companies for a while now. You guys do things the right way and continue to hold us and build and puts a smile on my face and I'm proud of you the team. Really appreciate you coming on and hope to have you on again until next time, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Unstoppable online and on socials?\nBrad Kam\nAbsolutely. So I would check out @unstoppableweb on Twitter. That's the best place to hear ideas about Web3 Domains names and know what's going on. And then I would also encourage everybody to check out unstoppabledomains.com and actually play around with it, try it out and see what it's like that's the best way to understand where it's sometimes can feel abstract but once you see it, I think it'll make a lot more sense.\nMatt Zahab\nYeah, very clean as well Brad, really appreciate this man. Thank you and looking forward to the next time.\nBrad Kam\nThank you appreciate it.\nMatt Zahab\nFolks. What an episode with Brad Kam from Unstoppable Domain. If you're looking for a Web3 name, head on over and get on boarded into the world of Web3. Huge thanks to Brad, he was dropping knowledge bombs left right and center.

We’re talking about Lido Finance (LDO), which has risen 7% in the past 24 hours and 17% over the past seven days, making it the 37th largest cryptocurrency by market cap.\nLido Finance is a decentralized liquid staking application that allows users to generate additional yield for staking their assets. The application currently offers support for five cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL), Kusama (KSM), and Polkadot (DOT).\nOf particular interest, however, is the first-mentioned altcoin, Ethereum. As Thor Hartvigsen, blockchain and defi researcher, explained, Liquid Staking Derivatives (LSD) altcoins could see a boom in 2023 as the second largest cryptocurrency by market cap implements the Shanghai upgrade.\nOf all major layer-1 blockchains, Ethereum has the lowest staking ratio of only 14%. In contrast, 90% of all BNB, 72% of all ADA, 68% of all SOL, and 62% of all AVAX are staked. The huge gap is likely related to the fact that ETH cannot yet be de-staked. However, the Shanghai hard fork planned for March will change that.\nWhile the analyst expects a major unstaking initially, the upgrade could trigger massive growth for liquid staking solutions in the long run. And Lido Finance (LDO) is currently the undisputed leader in the liquid staking of ETH, providing further rocket fuel for the LDO token.\nAltcoins Poised To Skyrocket Based On The Narrative\nHowever, not only the LDO but rather small LSD altcoins could benefit from the new narrative. As anonymous analyst “Karl” says, numerous LSD solutions are poised to wobble at the throne of Lido Finance. Currently, LDO’s market share is about 65.62%, followed by Rocket Pool (3.10%), StakeWise (0.9%), Ankr (0.81%), Frax Finance (0.67%), and Stafi (0.25%).\nAs the analyst assesses, the market caps of the altcoins Stakewise (SWISE) and Stafi (FIS) are still below $20 million, despite the fact that they control significant market share. “[T]heir tokenomics aren’t the best though, as there is still a considerable portion of the supply to be unlocked as team/investors’ allocation and liquidity mining rewards,” the analyst added.\nA look at the market share/market cap ratio also shows that both SWISE and FIS tokens are close behind the market leader, poised for future gains.\nAlso remarkable is Frax Finance, which recently entered the LSD landscape of altcoins and has already managed to capture a significant market share. Hartvigsen stated that in less than 2 months, Frax has managed to attract more than 45,000 ETH (about $55 million TVL).\nAccording to the analyst, there are “no signs of slowing down” as APRs are consistently at 9-10%, far outperforming any competitor. Frax Finance accomplishes this by giving users frxETH when they are either liquidity pooled on Curve (frxETH/ETH) or staked on Frax Finance (sfrxETH).\n“Only sfrxETH receives the ETH staking yield. This results in a higher APR as not all of the staked ETH is receiving the rewards as they are in the curve pool instead,” the analyst explained.\nBut Rocket Pool is also a prime candidate to grow from the new narrative due to its relative size, recent popularity growth, and several differentiators, Hartvigsen added.\nTwo Potential Spoilers For LDO\nHowever, in the near term, there could be two spoilers in particular for the price of the Lido Finance token, LDO. Both Nansen and Chain EDGE on-chain data shows that “smart money” has been selling LDO rather than buying it, Twitter user @AvaxGems pointed out.\nI guess not all of us are bullish on LSD coins.

The ex-company of Sam Bankman-Fried sold 719,498 LDO on December 28, worth about $717,451, for 601 ETH, and currently still has 1.86 million LDO left, the equivalent of about $1.81 million.\nFeatured image from Nasa / Unsplash, Charts from Messari, Twitter, TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 15:00:30", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "The lawyers also said Bankman-Fried's parents \"have received a steady stream of threatening correspondence, including communications expressing a desire that they suffer physical harm.

It also contains an old newspaper headline from The London Times, which reads \"Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.\" This was thought to be a statement about the state of money in general at the time, with banks being bailed out due to irresponsible banking practices.\nIt has been speculated that Satoshi used this header to signal opposition to the way big banks ran things before cryptocurrencies came into existence, and how something like Bitcoin could make those same banks redundant by providing decentralized solutions for financially managing transactions.\nThe Bitcoin blockchain itself has changed drastically since its humble beginnings 10 years ago, with the total number of blocks reaching 770,111.

In a letter published by the company’s president Yosuke Matsuda, the company committed to focusing on “blockchain entertainment” and Web3.\nIn 2022, Square Enix explored non-fungible token (NFT) initiatives. According to the company’s latest financial results, the digital asset and blockchain-based business saw positive feedback and good reception. Matsuda said:\n(…) we are most focused on blockchain entertainment, to which we have devoted aggressive investment and business development efforts. Looking externally, I think it is fair to say that blockchain gained significant recognition as a field in 2022 (…).\nSquare Enix Maintains Faith In Blockchain Technology For Entertainment\nAs seen in the chart below, the interest in the sector could be based on the spike in sales from mobile games. The net sales revenue from smart devices and PCs has been trending to the upside since 2020, becoming a bigger part of the company’s contribution.\nIn terms of the physical game versus digital game sales, the latter has become more critical for the company since Q3 2020. This metric continues to rise today and, combined with the net sales revenue, explains the interest in amplifying digital sales and entertainment.\nAs part of their expansion in the blockchain space, Square Enix will launch an overseas entity dedicated to “issuing, managing, and investing our own tokens” and publishing games in countries with “wide cryptocurrency adoption.”\nIn addition, the company is exploring launching a Corporate Venture Capital unit, issuing exclusive products as NFTs, and launching an NFT brand and a new IP based on this technology.\nIn that sense, the company included blockchain entertainment as a critical part of its medium-term business strategy. From 2021 to 2022, Square Enix launched “Shi‐San‐Sei Million Arthur” season one, a free-to-play mobile video game for Android and iOS.\nThe positive reception of this product is another factor that prompted the expansion of the company’s digital asset and blockchain business. In this series’ second season, Square Enix will implement a new strategy to explore features such as NFT ownership, “earning structures,” and much more.\nWorking On Crypto And NFT Regulations\nThe company’s president believes the implosion of FTX and other prominent players in the sector will push stricter regulations on blockchain technology. Thus, Square Enix will approach the Japanese and other governments to work on these regulations.\nThe company will help to clarify regulations around the nascent sector based on the idea that “new technologies and frameworks lead to innovation.” Square Enix’s president wrote the following on the future of NFTs and their maturation in the coming months; he invited people to think about these assets beyond their speculative capacity:\nNFTs and the metaverse in 2021, 2022 was a year of great volatility in the blockchain-related space. However, if this proves to have been a step in a process that leads to the creation of rules and a more transparent business environment, it will definitely have been for the good of the growth of blockchain entertainment.\nAs of this writing, Ethereum trades at $1,210 with sideways movement in the last 24 hours."}, {"date": "2023-01-03 14:28:14", "entity": ["crv", "ftx", "curve finance", "crv", "crv", "coin", "crv", "crv", "coinmarketcap", "crv", "curve", "crv", "trading ethereum whales", "curve", "ethereum whales", "crv", "crv", "crv", "crv", "curve finance", "defi", "crv", "dao", "lido finance", "crv", "crv", "curve finance", "zksync", "mainnet", "curve", "curve", "zksync"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "It seems that the collapse of FTX has turned the tables around for Curve Finance and its CRV token, as more people switched to DEXs and DeFi.\nCRV has dipped in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL) in 2022 which is considerably lower in comparison to its stats at the beginning of the year.\nHere’s a quick glance at how the coin has been performing:\nCRV price down by 1.46%\nToken weakens in terms of TVL in 2022\nTraders remain to be optimistic with CRV for 2023\nAccording to CoinMarketCap, CRV token price has plunged by 1.46% or currently trading at $0.5323 as of press time.\nImage: Texas Blockchain\nCRV Token Dominates DeFi Market By 44%\nWhile Curve Finance is dubbed to be one of the lead players of DeFi, CRV had some sluggish points and was unable to keep the momentum being one of the top two cryptos in terms of TVL; especially when pitted against Maker DAO (DAO) and Lido Finance (LIDO).\nOn the flip side, CRV still managed to dominate the DeFi market by 44% as seen on January 1, 2023. More so, the token has always led the DeFi space in terms of volume as it processes in large amounts or more than $100 million daily.\nOn December 14, Curve Finance announced that they would be integrating with zkSync 2.0 mainnet to further scale in terms of security and privacy.

However, CRV was down in terms of TVL since its peak was seen on April 2022. In this light, investor interest has also waned.\nThe price performance of CRV in 2022 wasn’t impressive as it has fallen to as much as 92.43%. CRV token looks to be in a state of doom but traders remain to be optimistic about it for 2023 and beyond. In fact, as of press time, the Binance funding rate was spotted at 0.05%.\nThis means that the traders are consistent with both the periodic payments in the derivates market as well as with the futures open interest.\nMeanwhle, the token’s TVL was pegged at $3.63 billion. This indicated that there was a potential threat to the protocol’s well-being.\nMoreover, there was no noticeable increase in the number of investors willing to put their money into the Curve pool.\nEven though CRV token revealed a spike previously, it’s the short-positioned traders who had the most difficulty considering the massive market washout.\n-Featured image: Zipmex"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 14:00:18", "entity": ["litecoin", "litecoin", "twitter. com", "litecoin", "unsplash tradingview. com", "litecoin", "bitpay", "litecoin whale", "binance", "litecoin whale", "binance", "service whale alert", "bitcoin", "grayscale", "ltc"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Data shows a Litecoin whale has withdrawn $32 million in LTC from Binance, a sign that could be positive for the latest rally.\nLitecoin Whale Takes Out $32M In LTC From Binance\nAs per data from the crypto transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a massive LTC transfer has taken place during the past day.

An unknown address is any address not affiliated with a known centralized platform and is thus likely to belong to a personal wallet.\nTransfers of this nature, where coins move from exchanges to personal wallets, are called exchange outflows, and since holders usually withdraw from these platforms for accumulation purposes, outflows can have a bullish effect on the price.\nHere, the exchange outflow was done by a whale, so it may mean that this humongous investor is planning to hold onto their Litecoin for an extended period of time. In the few days since the new year has started, LTC has been rallying up with the coin already reclaiming $75, so the whale not selling here to take advantage of this profitable opportunity and instead opting to accumulate suggests conviction from the investor that there is more to come for LTC.\nThere has also been another bullish signal for Litecoin recently, and it’s that the monthly LTC transactions on BitPay, the largest crypto payments processor, have gone up by 109% over the past year.

The blog covered points about how the industry has already established itself as a key player in the financial sector and summed up how the industry will be moving forward in light of the catastrophic events of 2022.\nThe blog detailed how 2022 turned out to be way worse than a mere “crypto winter” for most investors, as not one but three major catastrophic crashes wiped out nearly $2 trillion worth of assets from the speculative market. The international organization acknowledged that the year had proven right most policymakers, who had repeatedly issued warnings about the high-risk nature of the industry. WEF opined that the end of 2022 probably marked the end of crypto speculation due to the multiple hits the industry took this year.\nAn excerpt from the blog reads,\n“To the diehard crypto utopians (and some crypto-anarchists), 2022 was not just another “crypto winter,” but more of an ice age. Along with a broad loss of confidence, economic value and a market littered with the tombstones of failed firms and projects, perhaps the era of crypto speculation will remain frozen in ice.”\nWeb2 vs. Web3\nThe WEF also talked about the future of crypto while comparing it with the internet and the dot-com bubble burst of the early 2000s. That incident famously wiped out more speculative companies and pushed a more stable and durable version of the internet to the forefront. Similarly, the organization believes that the struggles of 2022 could open gates for “responsible, always-on internet finance,” claiming that countries that enforce responsible regulation of the sector will emerge as future leaders.\nWEF wrote,\n“Just as it took the dot-com bubble bursting in the early 2000s to hand over the future of the internet to more durable companies, business models, and use cases, perhaps 2022 marks a handover of crypto technology and blockchain infrastructure to steadier hands.”\nStaying Power Of Blockchain\nThe blog also pointed out the positives of the large-scale institutional adoption of crypto and blockchain technology that happened in 2022. It mentioned, by name, JPMorgan and the aggressively pro-crypto business strategy the financial giant adopted this year. According to the organization, crypto technology will become an inevitable part of innovation and business models, similar to cybersecurity and digital transformation mandates for major companies.\nWEF wrote,\n“Indeed, as a test of the staying power of digital assets and blockchains at the core of financial services (and other areas of the global economy), watch what the big banks and mature financial services firms do, not what they say.”\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, he alleged that Silbert and his companies have been stalling the entire process.\n“We appreciate that there are startup costs to any restructuring, and at times things don’t go as fast as we would all like. However, it is now becoming clear that you have been engaging in bad faith stall tactics.”\nHe also accused Silbert of refusing to “get into a room” with Gemini management, ironing things out, and refusing to agree to any timeline with the company after weeks of trying.\n“After six weeks, your behavior is not only completely unacceptable; it is unconscionable. The idea in your head that you can quietly hide in your ivory tower and that this will all just magically go away, or that this is someone else’s problem, is pure fantasy.”\nSilbert Fires Back\nAccording to the Winklevoss Twins, DCG owes Genesis around $1.67 billion, citing figures shared by Silvert with investors back in November. This figure also included a $575 million loan which was due in May, and a further $1.1 billion promissory note, tied to the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC). Silbert responded to Winklevoss, refuting the framing around the money owed to Genesis by DCG. He further claimed that DCG had sent a recent proposal to both Genesis and Gemini. Silbert Stated,\n“DCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis. DCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding; next loan maturity is May 2023. DCG delivered a proposal to Genesis and your advisors on the 29th of December and has not received any response.”\nOn his part, Winklevoss asked Silbert to publicly commit to resolving the ongoing deadlock by the 8th of January, 2023. However, he did not elaborate on any potential consequences or future action should Silbert not comply.\n“There you go again. Stop trying to pretend that you and DCG are innocent bystanders and had nothing to do with creating this mess. It’s completely disingenuous. Will you, or will you not, commit to solving this by the 8th of January in a manner that treats the $1.1 billion promissory note as $1.1 billion?”\nThe Gemini Earn Program\nThe Gemini Earn Program is a high-yield savings product, offering users an annual return of up to 8% on their crypto deposits, depending on where the assets in question are held. Genesis was Gemini’s primary lending partner, and when Genesis suspended loan withdrawals, it led to Gemini halting withdrawals for its Earn program as well. Winklevoss has pegged the amount owed to Gemini Earn Customers at $900 million. Back in November, Silbert tried to reassure investors that DCG did not face any immediate risk following FTX’s collapse.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to Santiment, this was part of a bigger ascending trend that may eventually form a triangle, and the XRP price is currently at the bottom of this triangle.\nSecond, over the past six months, the group of XRP holders that possess between 1 million and 10 million XRP has increased their holdings by 25%, bringing the total to 4.09 billion XRP. This degree of accumulation is typical at market bottoms.\nThird, Binance's funding rate for XRP is slightly negative, indicating a bearish sentiment among this set of traders.\nFourth, the MVRV 30-day for XRP, which assesses their profit or loss, shows that short-term traders are currently experiencing average losses of -7%. Therefore, they might be reluctant to sell their coins at a loss, which would boost the price of XRP.\nLast but not least, if the MVRV Long/Short difference, which measures the difference between the average gain or loss of long-term holders and short-term holdings, is rising while the price is largely moving sideways, it may indicate that long-term holders are growing more optimistic and increasing their holdings.\nWill XRP price rally in 2023?\nAside from the favorable technical and fundamental factors listed above, the successful resolution of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit is expected in 2023, which many expect will boost the XRP price.\nOn the general crypto market, investors continue to watch out for clues as to the Fed's interest rate hike throughout 2023.

The Winklevoss twins have given DCG an ultimatum of January 8th to return the $900 million Gemini Earn customer funds, while the users themselves have filed a class action lawsuit against both companies.\nIn addition, in what is believed to be a tactical decision, Valkyrie Investments and Fir Tree recently got involved in the “Shakespearean drama,” as NewsBTC reported yesterday. Thus, the pressure on DCG CEO Barry Silbert is building up day by day, while he is presumably hoping for Feb. 3rd when a three-judge panel will rule on the complaint against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for refusing to convert GBTC into a Bitcoin spot ETF.\nThese Altcoins Are The Biggest Holdings Of DCG And Grayscale\nAs many know, Grayscale owns a massive amount of Bitcoin as part of its GBTC, namely more than 630,000 BTC, which is causing great concerns among investors. However, as a Twitter user, Karl shows, not only BTC investors but also altcoin investors should be rooting for Silbert’s companies to survive.\nWhile the more than 630,000 BTC “only” represent 3.28% of all Bitcoins in circulation, there are two altcoins owned by the company that represents an even higher percentage of the total market cap. Within its other trusts, Grayscale holds a staggering 8.53% of all Ethereum Classic (ETC), the equivalent of around $189 million. Second, on the list is Horizen (ZEN). The share of the total market capital is 4.64%, around $5.7 million.\nBut Grayscale also has an immensely high share of ZCash (ZEC) and Ethereum (ETH) with 2.53% and 2.52%, respectively. They are followed by Litecoin (2.11%), Bitcoin Cash (1.6%), and MANA (1%).\nif Grayscale is forced to sell their balance sheet to cover Genesis' creditors, these tokens would be the most impacted pic.twitter.com/13Lo0yYPl9 — Karl (@karl_0x) January 2, 2023\nThe main concern for the above cryptocurrency investors could be that the company led by Micheal Sonnenshein is liquidating some of its altcoin trusts to save its flagship product the GBTC and possibly Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETHE) and the entire Digital Currency Group. Silbert could use the funds to serve creditors.\nGiven the massive stakes in the overall market, it would be almost impossible to rule out the possibility of the already underperforming altcoins suffering even higher, hefty losses due to a Grayscale dump.\nThe Ethereum Classic price is currently 90.85% below its all-time high of $176.16, while Horizen is trading 94.44% below its all-time high of $168.15. The biggest loss comes from Zcash, which is 99.36% below the all-time high of $5,941.80.\nHurdles For Grayscale For Dissolving Their Trusts\nWhether there will be a dissolution of all or only some of the trusts can only be speculated at this time. CEO Michael Sonnenshein had emphasized several times in recent weeks that Grayscale has no intention of dissolving the GBTC fund.\nDespite that, he brought into play the option of returning up to 20% of GBTC’s capital to shareholders if he fails to convert the product into an exchange-traded fund two weeks ago.\nStill, there are high legal hurdles. It’s important to remember that Grayscale is regulated by the SEC. Dissolving trusts requires an application to the SEC, and the process is very lengthy and difficult, on the other hand not impossible as evidenced by the dissolution of the XRP trust as a result of the SEC lawsuit against Ripple.\nGrayscale has a low-risk, high-return project. However, the current developments put massive pressure on DCG and therefore also on Grayscale. Due to the connections through loans between both companies, a downfall of the parent company could also drag the cash cow Grayscale down with it.\nHowever, it is important to emphasize that a downfall does not necessarily mean a dump of all coins at once. If there is a Reg M solution, probably not all Grayscale investors would want to sell. It, therefore, remains important for investors to monitor the development of the DCG/ Grayscale drama.\nAt press time, the Ethereum price stood at $1,216, still lagging momentum.\nFeatured image from Twitter, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 11:30:00", "entity": ["bitcoin", "ethereum", "cubic analytics", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "bitcoin", "btc", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "silver", "btc", "sec", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "ethereum", "bitcoin", "btc", "u", "silver and gold"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "This crypto analyst says Bitcoin may succeed at this setup where Ethereum failed to rise in December\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

As Bitcoinist reported, the dispute ended with Schwartz ignoring his counterpart while Wright threatened to submit a scientific paper on XRP to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as support in the lawsuit.\nAfter a brief lull in the fight, the verbal dispute found a revival over the last two days. Wright, the leading figure behind Bitcoin SV (BSV), responded to a screenshot of a years-old tweet from Schwartz in which the Ripple CTO stated that Wright is not the inventor of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\nWright didn’t let that stand, saying that the Ripple CTO doesn’t understand that it’s not “just” a computer science problem. “Not banking, not economics, not law. And this is why XRP is failing,” Wright continued.\nTriggered by that statement, Schwartz settled into round two of the verbal battle, asking “curiously” what his definition of failing is. “It’s certainly not market cap given that XRP’s market cap is around $17 billion and BSV’s is less than $1 billion. Maybe it’s market volume? XRP at $330 million versus BSV at about $20 million? Nope, I guess it’s not that either,” Schwartz said, adding:\nIt’s your minor fork of a minor fork that’s failing by every conceivable metric as you keep lashing out at everyone who forces you to confront any tiny sliver of reality.\nRipple Can’t Scale XRP\nSubsequently, the discussion evolved toward Wright’s claim that the XRP Ledger cannot scale. Both competitors debated the merits and weaknesses of XRP compared to Wright’s Bitcoin alternative – BSV. According to Wright, the blockchain that can scale will prevail, which the Bitcoin SV founder says only works with larger blocks.\nThe Ripple CTO countered that there are two main reasons why this is not true. “One is that I think nearly all layer 1’s will scale if there’s enough demand, whether through federation, roll ups, higher layers, or other ways,” Schwartz said.\nOn the other hand, Schwartz believes layer 1 doesn’t need to scale, it just needs to exist and be usable to move the vast majority of traffic to more efficient mechanisms.\n[…] And my position on this has changed a few times. It’s also not a yes/no thing. It’s really a question of how much scaling will provide how much difference in value/utility. I do not believe layer 1’s will need millions of txns/sec for decades, if ever.\nCalvin Ayre, Craig Wright’s verbose sidekick, countered the argument with the following words:\nThis is why you should stop talking…all of this can be done on chain…the tech has existed since 2009 when Craig released Bitcoin….nChain has bits of it patented now. Just shut up and watch since you clearly don’t understand.\nDavid Schwartz was visibly annoyed by the wild name-calling:\nYou are responding to a reasoned argument with vague gibberish mixed with personal insults just as Craig does. I can see why you two get along so well.\nSchwartz also ultimately rejected the idea that he instigated the whole affair, claiming that he was merely pointing out how wrong Wright was. Ultimately, he ended round two by saying:\nHe [Craig Wright] is only interested in XRP because he thinks that if I think he’s hurting XRP, I’ll stop pointing out that he’s wrong in public. He only started talking about it when I showed that an argument he made (that had nothing to do with XRP) was complete nonsense.\nAt press time, the XRP price stood at $0.3470 after seeing a long-legged Doji candle in the 1-day chart yesterday.\nFeatured image from Forbes, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-03 09:13:26", "entity": ["of energy", "russian federation", "of energy", "siberia", "shulginov", "federation ethereum", "bitcoin", "russian federation"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "As the war in Ukraine continues in its 10th month, the Russian Federation recently announced a possible increase in energy production as demand from crypto miners increased.\nThis increase in crypto mining can be attributed to the Federation’s push to legalize the use of crypto as a means to conduct international trade.\nThe Russian energy minister has admitted that the industry’s rising need for electricity may necessitate the installation of additional power plants in Siberia.\nRussia has been the subject of controversy both domestic and international since the start of its “special military operation” in Ukraine.\nThe country, already sanctioned by the European Union and the United States, now has international assets seized and its banking system cut from the SWIFT protocol.\nImage: Wired\nIs Crypto The Answer To Russia’s Woes?\nNikolay Shulginov, Russia’s Minister of Energy, has acknowledged the growing need for energy from cryptocurrency miners in certain regions of Siberia.\nAccording to reports in the local press and in crypto-focused media, Shulginov is aware that more power facilities would be needed to meet their demands.\nRussia has followed India in the regulation of digital assets with Moscow even considering a digital Ruble as they tend to the crypto miners’ need for energy.\nThis fundamental switch in sentiment from outright banning cryptocurrency to legalizing it is courtesy of the West’s sanctions on the country.\nWith the West having little regulation regarding crypto and its use in international trade, Russia can use crypto as a means to conduct international trade.\nHowever, even though the country has experienced a mining revenue boom last year, it is still not sold on the idea of allowing its citizens to use crypto as a means for payment.

The new tokenomics model would see the introduction of time-lock tiers for emission-based rewards. It would also introduce a token-burning mechanism and liquidity lock for price support.

Elaborating on the rationale behind the move, Matthew Lilley, SushiSwap CTO, stated that Kashi had several issues, including several design flaws, a lack of resources, and considerable losses. However, in the larger picture, the team had to prioritize and improve their most prominent offering, the SushiSwap DEX.\n“We made the decision to deprecate Kashi (Sushi Lending) and Miso (Sushi Launch Pad). 1. Kashi, for a number of reasons, had a number of design flaws, ran at a loss, and had a lack of resources to dedicate to it. 2. MISO had a lack of resources.”\nLilley assured the community that they do plan on launching new staking and launchpad products in the near future to replace the soon-to-be-defunct services as soon as additional liquidity becomes available. However, for now, the team’s focus would be on the DEX, which he described as the “breadwinner” of the company.\n“We have the plan to launch successors of these products in the future once we have the resources to dedicate product teams towards them, but believe that requires focusing entirely on the breadwinner at the time being, which is inarguably the DEX.”\nAn Expected Move\nThe move to shutter the two platforms did not surprise many, with developers having already announced in mid-December that the Kashi 1.0 interface would no longer support deposits or borrowing. According to the announcement, the original UI would remain online, but the markets would not be updated. It also stated that MISO UI would be accessible indefinitely, but no further support or development would be provided.\nSushiSwap’s Recent Financial Woes\nSushiSwap has made the decision to shutter specific offerings against the backdrop of significant financial stress over the past few months. In an update shared in December, the firm revealed it had only 1.5 years of operating costs in hand, and the situation required immediate attention and action to ensure that the firm had sufficient resources to ensure seamless operations.\nCEO Grey had stated that the company was pursuing a strategy that would see it renegotiate infrastructure contracts and cut back on underperforming and superfluous dependencies. It would also enforce a budget freeze on non-critical personnel and infrastructure as it looks to cut back on expenses. Gray also revealed the company had made a loss of $30 million over the past 12 months.\n“In the past 12 months, Sushi has experienced a 30M USD loss in its emissions-based reward strategy to bootstrap liquidity & incentivize LPing; Sushi spends more on emissions than swap volume generated.”\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.”\nThe company also announced a brand new fund called the “Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, LP” which it says was created to help investors take advantage of the GBTC discount to NAV. “we are very interested in realizing the true value of the underlying bitcoin for our investors and will actively pursue this goal on their behalf,” McClurg said.\nGBTC sells trading at $8.11 | Source: Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) on TradingView.com\nThe Roadmap To Success\nValkyrie’s statement also included its plan to actually improve the management of the Grayscale bitcoin trust if it were to take over. These were divided into three points.\nThe first was that it plans to facilitate orderly redemptions for investors at NAV when they want it through a Regulation M filing. According to the statement, this would allow the investors to redeem shares without delays and at a fair price.\nNext was the plan to lower the fees associated with the fund. Valkyrie wants an over 50% reduction in the fee to fit in with best industry practices. As such, it plans to reduce the fee from 200 basis points to 75 basis points.\nLast but not is the fact that Valkyrie wants to honor investor share redemptions in both BTC and cash. Its reasoning behind this was that it believes that it gives investors “greater flexibility and choice when it comes to redeeming their shares.”\nMcClurg closes out the statement with a call for the statement to be considered. “We are committed to putting the interests of GBTC shareholders first, and we have the experience and expertise to do so effectively,” the co-founder said.\nThe GBTC discount to NAV remains high despite some recovery recorded as 2022 drew to a close. It had reached a high of 48.57% on Dec. 16 but by the end of the day on Friday, Dec. 30, the GBTC discount had fallen to 45.17%.\nFeatured image from Bloomberg, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-02 23:00:29", "entity": ["bitcoinist", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "jarvis labs", "lilly", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "u. s. federal reserve", "gbtc", "arrows capital", "genesis", "dcg", "blockfi", "voyager", "u. s. federal reserve", "ftx", "jarvis labs", "ftx", "jarvis"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral"], "content": "2022 is coming to an end, and our staff at Bitcoinist decided to launch this Crypto Holiday Special to provide some perspective on the crypto industry. We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto.\nIn the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.\nBen Lilly: “(…) for fundamentals… Nothing has changed. If anything, builders are building faster than ever before. All of us veterans know that right now are the most productive weeks you can have in crypto. It is a blessing to those that can weather such bearish times.”\nAnd now, for a bonus round, we spoke with Ben Lilly, Co-Founder at Jarvis Labs, the on-chain analytics and token design firm tracking the crypto market. Lilly offered his views on the industry’s current state, why the Bear Market must be used as a time for building, and why the nascent class has matured. This is what he told us:\nQ: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid?\nA: In December 2021 we were discussing whether or not the U.S. Federal Reserve would follow through on rate hikes in the face of bubbling inflation. A year later, what we’ve seen is a strategic push on saying they will take two steps, and instead take three in a hawkish/bearish manner. It has not only hurt markets, but ensured markets could not find any solid footing to build momentum on.\nThis mentality led to a rapid hiking regime. The down wind effects were dollars as a currency were the asset to hold. And most everything else lost value to the dollar.\nA lot of people like to say Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other assets “lost value”. This is a misnomer. We price things in U.S. dollars, and relative to the dollar, these assets lost considerable value.\nWhat a lot of people are also slowly realizing is that most participants in crypto markets are and were speculators. This is rather unfortunate, in my opinion. And something I look to track better with data.\nThe drop in speculators (and many market makers closing up shops) has left a significant hole in liquidity. We are well aware of this. It is very difficult for market makers to run smoothly on some second tier exchanges as the books are pretty dry. We understand this well as we began to explore market making since our team has run autonomous trading systems for half a decade now. Clients are asking us more now than ever to do market making, so our team has begun ramping up these operations for 2023.\nAs for fundamentals… Nothing has changed. If anything, builders are building faster than ever before. All of us veterans know that right now are the most productive weeks you can have in crypto. It is a blessing to those that can weather such bearish times. I’m seeing some really impressive tech solutions coming to fruition right now. Our team is testing some of them currently and look to broaden our functionality onchain in the coming months – something we’ve been exploring for years now. To us, it’s a testament to the fundamentals of the industry only getting better.\nQ: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision?\nA: Operations that take place onchain are becoming more desirable than before. Our clients are pushing us in this direction, which tells us the don’t trust, verify mentality is becoming more prominent. I love hearing this and hope to push everything we do to be fully onchain in the years to come.\nI’ll put it this way, never would I have imagined our team would be looking into zero knowledge technology to run part of our operations. To put it simply, the vision is the same, just more crystallized – a process that will keep happening as years pass.\nQ: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right?\nA: The significant moment was GBTC sliding into negative NAV.\nAs the tide was pulled out in 2022, we learned what was really happening in the waters of crypto, and we see many blowups having origins with the Grayscale Trust product.\nThree Arrows Capital, Genesis, DCG, BlockFi, Voyager, and others were all associated with the Trust and as the value of the Trust was more than the worth of all the shares outstanding (negative NAV), market dynamics caused spot demand to wane around April 2021.\nThe timing with this and what the U.S. Federal Reserve did with rate hikes was like a double edge sword where both edges were pointed in the same direction. Higher rates and lower spot demand due to a toxic Grayscale product meant the bear market sword cut twice as much.\nAs for 2023, I still think some of the worst is yet to come. I’m not necessarily referring to price here. I’m talking about operations not having enough cash to weather the winter. Revenues are down, new entrants to crypto are down. While I think this is good in a way because it rids the industry of poorly run businesses, it’ll cause some headline fears for the industry as companies close their doors.\nIt won’t be the end of the industry from my vantage point. Those that have capital have plenty of runway. And even those that don’t have multi-year runways are staffed by very passionate builders. By the end of 2023 we will see the market coming back to life with lots of excitement. I don’t believe it’ll be a full blown bull market by any means… It’ll be more about projects rolling out the things that they’ve been busy building for the year. You give a bunch of crypto devs a year to build, the results are jaw dropping.\nQ: And, of course, we have to ask; many claim that the FTX collapse is setting the industry back to the 2018 bear market. Back to the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) era, to the so-called “Wild Wild West” days of crypto, what do you think about this idea, and where do you think the industry stands now? More importantly, what is Jarvis’ role in this context, and where do you aim to be in 2023 and beyond?\nA: Crypto is maturing just like all of us do as we age. You ask anybody who has had ups and downs if they were set back to when they were a younger version of themselves… Most will say they are much wiser, and often the setbacks is how we truly realize our potential. Crypto is the same.\nWe discussed earlier about how onchain solutions are more in demand than ever… Well the industry had a bad go at centralized entities like FTX, which had one goal of making money, and not contributing to the space.\nThe space will be wiser moving forward. And we hope Jarvis Labs can help push this mindset. Our team has been busy in many verticals. We have teams building software solutions, new metrics, dashboards, token designs, algorithms, and a few other things that we will unveil soon. But if I had to keep it to one role, it’s to help empower everybody to hold crypto to a higher standard. We can be better. Let’s be better."}, {"date": "2023-01-02 20:28:02", "entity": ["bank of england", "bank of england", "boe", "boe", "coindesk", "hm revenue", "customs,", "hm revenue", "and customs", "boe"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "In its latest effort to become a global cryptocurrency hub, the United Kingdom has introduced a tax exemption for non-residents and foreign investors.

On higher timeframes, BTC’s price records similar price action. Other cryptocurrencies in the top 10 by market capitalization follow this trajectory.\nWill History Repeat For Bitcoin? Pain Levels Max Out\nAccording to analyst Will Clement from Reflexivity Research, the price of Bitcoin is approaching critical levels on its Net Realized Profit and Loss Over Market Cap. This indicator measures the capital gain or loss for the cryptocurrency.\nAs seen in the chart below, the metric is nearing levels of absolute capitulation when the crypto market and its participants are at their lowest. The industry approached a similar level in 2018 when BTC crashed from $20,000 and Ethereum from $1,400.\nIn 2014 and 2015, the metric dropped into this territory following the collapse of the biggest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox. Today, with the collapse of prominent crypto companies, such as FTX and Three Arrows Capital, the market is close to previous cycle bottoms.\nClemente said the following about this metric and its implication for the price of Bitcoin:\nCapitulation, represented by net realized losses adjusted for market cap, is on-par with any prior macro Bitcoin bottom. Major pain is being felt in this market.\nJanuary Is The Worst Month To Expect Profits?\nDespite the metrics and indicators pointing towards extreme market sentiment and capitulation levels, the timing might remain unfavorable for Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency might see further sideways price action and additional losses until there is a change in macroeconomic conditions.\nAdditional data from a pseudonym analyst indicates that January is historically a red month for the cryptocurrency. In the past two years, the returns for BTC in January were a historical exception.\nSince 2015, the cryptocurrency has been trading in the red during January, recording some of its worst losses. 2023 could see BTC return to that dynamic, but this period of losses might precede two months of gains.\nIn February and March, Bitcoin saw its best performance, as seen in the chart.

The whole world is watching crypto right now—for the wrong reasons.\nBut the year wasn't all bad. The industry saw glimmers of positive progress that you'd be excused for having missed, or for having forgotten about, amid the mass freakout over the alleged fraud of Sam Bankman-Fried.\nEthereum merged\nAfter years of waiting, and many, many delays, the Ethereum merge event happened in September and went off without a hitch. Ethereum, the No. 2 cryptocurrency, transitioned from the energy-intensive proof-of-work mining mechanism that Bitcoin uses (and that has long been the punching bag of environmentalists) to a proof-of-stake mechanism that uses 99% less electricity.\nThe impact of this transition might take years for people to understand, but it could put Ethereum in a pole position to rival Bitcoin in adoption and maybe even, someday, value. Just because the price of ETH didn't budge from the event, and just because the mainstream reaction felt like a whimper instead of a bang, does not mean the merge was a shrug. (It also took place at a moment when the U.S. economy was cratering, inflation was soaring, and every investment asset class was down bad.)\n\"It was a mammoth undertaking that the Ethereum developer community handled remarkably well,\" ConsenSys CEO Joe Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum, told me in October. \"It was, I think, the last major question mark surrounding the question of whether Ethereum will be systemically important going forward... And I think our colleagues in other ecosystems probably feel a little more respect for the Ethereum ecosystem.\" They do: even former \"Bitcoin maximalists\" acknowledged the significance of the merge.\nLegislative momentum\nIn crypto, everyone talks about regulation as a dreaded bogeyman: regulation = death. This is understandable, since the entire original appeal of crypto for many was to cut out the middlemen, decentralize everything, and exist outside the reaches of government regulation. As years have gone by, it's become abundantly clear that this is not a realistic vision for most projects. Just look at the shocking sanctioning of Tornado Cash this year. The future of crypto is going to look more regulated than purists wanted—but regulation does not necessarily mean interference.\nWhile SEC Chair Gary Gensler's statements have been very chilling indeed, other key figures in D.C. are much more open-minded and are working on legislation that would regulate crypto markets in a way that doesn't chill innovation. Senators Lummis and Gillibrand have reached across the aisle to partner on a bill that would put the CFTC in charge of crypto rather than the SEC (sorry, Gary), and Coinbase is throwing its support behind two other bills (one from Senators Stabenow and Boozman in the Senate, and one from Reps. Thompson and Khanna in the House) that have a similar aim.\nAD\nAD\nThe point is: there are encouraging regulatory steps happening quietly while everyone in crypto busies themselves panicking about Gensler and the SEC. Even President Biden's crypto executive order back in March should be taken as a positive indicator: the order was a (mild) call to multiple agencies to get on the same page about regulating crypto; it didn't say \"shut it all down.\" Meanwhile abroad, the Europe Parliament passed a crypto legislative package in March that specifically mentioned \"ensuring that the EU financial services regulatory framework is innovation-friendly and does not pose obstacles to the application of new technologies.”\nVCs still believe\nCall them crazy or deluded, but VC firms keep putting money into Web3 plays. Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), the elephant in the room in Web3, raised $4.5 billion for yet another crypto-centric fund (its fourth); a16z alum Katie Haun's Haun Ventures raised $1.5 billion for crypto investments; Pantera raised $1.3 billion for a blockchain fund. A slew of crypto companies and projects got money even in the deep freeze of a crypto winter, including Fireblocks ($550 million), ConsenSys ($450 million), Secret Network ($400 million), NEAR ($350 million), Chainalysis ($170 million), Keyrock ($72 million), and Ramp ($70 million), just to name a few.\nOh, and there was a crypto derivatives exchange called FTX that raised $800 million in 2022 ($400 million for FTX and $400 million for the \"separate\" FTX US entity) at a $32 billion valuation.\nOops. That last example is a reminder: VCs can get it very, very wrong. It's their job to throw money at a bunch of things and hope that a couple hit big. But even after the string of collapses and bankruptcies of 2022, those with deep pockets still want to give crypto founders money.\nBig brands moved into NFTs\nYes, the speculative bubble of quick-flipping JPEGs popped. To deny that, you'd need your head checked. But that was mostly the PFP (profile picture) crowd, coughing up hundreds of thousands of dollars for a cartoon ape. That madness brought us rug pulls, comically botched art reveals, and \"wash trading\" to inflate a new marketplace's sales volume.\nAs multiple leaders in the NFT space have said since the bubble popped, the mania was not sustainable for the space. “From a mental health perspective it wasn't healthy for Art Blocks as a team, and it wasn't healthy for Art Blocks artists,” Art Blocks founder Erick Calderon told us on the gm podcast.\nIn the aftermath, as the dust settles, real use cases remain. NFTs are just tokens (I believe we'll stop using all these acronyms and jargon soon enough) that can function as anything that needs instant provable ownership, from a party pass to a sports ticket to club membership to a real estate deed. These are the legitimate possibilities that excite people who are able to look past the point-and-laugh dismissiveness of those who appear to be triggered by the very term \"NFT.\"\nBelievers now include big brands like Tiffany, Adidas, Starbucks, Bud Light, Instagram, and Reddit, all of which made moves to embrace NFTs—even after NFT trading volume plummeted. (And a shoutout to Polygon, chosen as the blockchain partner for three of those brands.) Are all those brands totally and humiliatingly wrong, or is it possible they're on to something?\nYosuke Matsuda, president of \"Final Fantasy\" game publisher Square Enix, sounded a bullish note on NFTs in his year-end letter: \"I expect to see an eventual right-sizing in digital goods deals as they become more commonplace among the general public, with the value of each available content corrected to their true estimated worth, and I look for them to become as familiar as dealings in physical goods.\"\nCrypto media stays hungry\nTo end on a more meta (not the company) note: Sam Bankman-Fried's cinematic fall has been a boom time for crypto media. The FTX collapse sparked a mainstream fascination beyond anything that has ever happened in crypto—bigger than Mt. Gox, bigger than Silk Road, bigger than The DAO hack, bigger than the Quadriga fiasco, bigger than the sudden bull run of 2017.\nAD\nAD\nI have been writing about Bitcoin since 2011, and never has my phone and inbox blown up with this many queries from crypto-curious friends and family members. Mainstream print and broadcast outlets are recognizing that they need to understand and report on crypto happenings. I'm proud of how our team of journalists has covered the FTX story, and also happy to see great work from some of our peers (in particular CoinDesk, which has earned lots of attention for its Alameda balance sheet scoop).\nSo while it might sound contradictory to say at a time when crypto markets are in deep winter and the biggest news is negative: it's a thrilling time to be reporting on crypto. As I like to say, it's never boring. I hope you'll stick with Decrypt in 2023 for crypto-breaking news, education, buzz, and insight."}, {"date": "2023-01-02 19:25:30", "entity": ["ftx"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "The majority of Americans view cryptocurrency as an unsafe financial investment, according to a recent YouGov poll of more than 1,200 US citizens.\nThe survey revealed that 55% consider it to be either very or somewhat unsafe, with only 18% describing it as safe.\nFurthermore, even those who already own cryptocurrencies are almost as likely to view it as an unsafe as those who are yet to buy digital assets.\nThe results also suggest that many Americans would like the US government to ramp up crypto regulation.

However, some major financial institutions have been lost on the idea of cryptocurrency as a portfolio diversifier due to the many controversies that plagued the crypto market.\nIf Rekt Capital’s hypothesis, which essentially says that 2023 will be the accumulation period before the potential 2024 crypto bull market, is true, gains will be up for the entire crypto market, especially Bitcoin Cash.\nHowever, with the broader financial market having its worst year since the 2008 crisis, we can set 2023 to be a slow but steady phase of loss and gradual gain in the next few months.\nIn the short term, potential BCH investors and traders could hope that the current support at $96.18 will hold. But with potential downturns caused by further interest rate increases, we might see BCH bears test the $89.17 in the coming weeks.\nWith the start of another fiscal year, BCH investors and traders should watch out for macroeconomic developments as it also holds sway on the crypto market. Caution should still be exercised as the future is still uncertain for Bitcoin Cash and crypto as a whole.\n-Featured image: Binance Academy"}, {"date": "2023-01-02 19:06:40", "entity": ["gg", "square enix", "final fantasy", "dragon quest", "square enix", "zynga", "horizon game studios", "ubisoft", "rockstar games", "grand theft auto v", "web3", "web3 gaming", "nft collectibles", "ad ad square enix", "matsuda", "matsuda", "web3", "square enix", "ubisoft", "assassin", "creed", "just dance", "ghost recon", "rockstar games", "grand theft auto", "nba", "ftx", "matsuda", "square enix", "square enix", "matsuda", "ethereum", "symbiogenesis", "square enix", "polygon", "bitcoin gaming", "zebedee", "square enix", "enjin", "efinity", "square enix", "tomb raider", "deus ex", "embracer group"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "This story comes from GG.\nYour Web3 Gaming Power-Up Discover GG\nEven as crypto markets remain down and many video game enthusiasts vocally oppose the potential for NFTs in gaming, one major game publisher remains focused on Web3 gaming: Square Enix, the creator of major franchises like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest.\nThe Japanese firm has gradually increased its investment and presence in the Web3 space over the last few years, and in President Yosuke Matsuda’s annual new year’s letter for 2023, he explained that Square Enix is “most focused” on blockchain-powered gaming amid its new business development efforts.\nAD\nAD\nSquare Enix is developing “multiple blockchain games” based on original IP, rather than its existing franchises, Matsuda wrote, and the firm plans to announce further games this year. The firm is also still considering investment opportunities around blockchain. “[We] will continue to take stakes in promising businesses whether we find them in Japan or abroad,” he wrote.\nMatsuda’s letter highlights the growing use of the term Web3, which he writes has become “a firmly established buzzword among businesspeople.” However, he also notes the market challenges that emerged in 2022, including the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX in November and the subsequent industry contagion.\n“Blockchain has been an object of exhilaration and a source of turmoil,” Matsuda explained, “but with that in the rearview mirror, we hope that blockchain games will transition to a new stage of growth in 2023.”\nRising interest in blockchain technology has been a mainstay of Matsuda’s annual letter in recent years, and Square Enix has ramped up its moves in the space along the way.\nIn November, Square Enix announced its first original game built around Ethereum NFTs, called Symbiogenesis. Set to launch this spring, it’s a “digital collectible art experience” with storytelling elements. The firm recently tweeted that the “gameplay revolves around choosing whether to monopolize or [share]” information with other players.\nSquare Enix also recently announced that it will be a strategic advisor to Cross the Ages, a digital trading card game built on Polygon, and invested in Bitcoin gaming startup ZEBEDEE. It also invested in metaverse game The Sandbox in 2020, and last year revealed plans to revive its dormant Dungeon Siege property as an in-game experience in The Sandbox.\nAlso last year, Square Enix announced plans to release Final Fantasy NFTs via Enjin’s Polkadot-based Efinity platform. The NFTs are based on the popular game Final Fantasy VII, and are tied to physical trading cards and toys that will be released this year.\nLast May, Square Enix sold off three of its internal studios along with major franchises—including Tomb Raider and Deus Ex—to Embracer Group for $300 million. The publisher said that the sale would benefit its growing push into blockchain games.\nAD\nAD\nSquare Enix is one of a handful of major traditional game publishers that have committed to growing the blockchain space. Ubisoft, the maker of Assassin’s Creed and Just Dance, has invested in and partnered with a number of crypto game studios, and released the first in-game NFT items for a major franchise game in late 2021 with Ghost Recon: Breakpoint.\nMeanwhile, Take-Two Interactive—the publisher behind Rockstar Games and 2K Games, makers of Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K respectively—has pushed into the NFT space through its casual games studio, Zynga. Take-Two also invested in Horizon Game Studios alongside Ubisoft, but Rockstar Games has since banned the use of NFTs on Grand Theft Auto V servers.\nWeb3 advocates believe that NFTs—or tokens that represent ownership of unique items—can fuel decentralized, player-owned game economies, and benefit players via the ability to resell items and potentially use them across multiple games.\nHowever, many gamers have pushed back against the rise of Web3 gaming and NFT collectibles, pointing to scams in the crypto industry, simplistic gameplay for many early Web3 gaming examples, and speculative demand that has driven up the prices of some assets.\nIn his letter, Matsuda highlighted the past speculative frenzy around NFTs but wrote that he believes that the focus on monetization will give way to a growing view of the prospective functional benefits of NFTs for gamers.\n“In the wake of the aforementioned turbulence in the cryptocurrency industry, there is now a trend to view blockchain technology as a mere means to an end, and to discuss what needs to happen to achieve the end of delivering new experiences and excitement to customers,” he wrote. “I see this as a very beneficial development for the future growth of the industry.”"}, {"date": "2023-01-02 19:00:24", "entity": ["whales crypto whale tracker", "whalestats", "shiba inu", "curve dao tok ethereum matic", "ethereum", "polygon", "santiment", "polygon", "polygon", "matic", "polygon ethereum", "ethereum", "matic", "polygon", "matic", "matic", "cardano", "polkadot", "unsplash. com", "tradingview. com"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Positive", "Negative", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Polygon has surged 3% in the last 24 hours as data shows Ethereum whales have been shopping up MATIC this New Year.\n500 Biggest Ethereum Whales Have MATIC In Their Top 10 Purchased List\n2022 was an abysmal year for Polygon investors as the cryptocurrency finished the year with losses amounting to more than 70%, but the coin has had a more optimistic start to 2023.\nAt the time of writing, MATIC is trading around $0.7795, up 3% in the last 24 hours. Here is a chart that shows the trend in the price of the asset over the last five days:\nLooks like the value of the crypto has seen some surge in the past day | Source: MATICUSD on TradingView\nAs shown in the above graph, Polygon started the year by observing some fresh uptrend. However, because MATIC saw some losses in the final days of 2022, the crypto is still 3% in the red in terms of returns over the last seven days, as today’s rise hasn’t been enough to compensate for those losses yet.\nThe reason behind this latest surge in the price of the coin may have been due to buying pressure from the Ethereum whales. As per data from crypto whale tracker service WhaleStats, the 500 biggest ETH whales were accumulating Polygon during the New Year as the token made it into their top 10 list of most purchased coins. Other coins bought up by this cohort include Shiba Inu (SHIB), Curve DAO token (CRV), and WETH (Wrapped Ether).\nAlso, today’s stats of the top 100 Ethereum whales include MATIC, with the coin being their 5th most purchased token in the last 24 hours.\nThis means that Ethereum whales have constantly been picking up Polygon in the first two days of the year so far.\nPolygon Didn’t Observe Much Dev Activity In 2022\nWhile accumulation from the whales is certainly a bullish signal for the price of MATIC, there has also been some negative news for the crypto. The on-chain analytics firm Santiment recently released its top 10 list for cryptos based on developer activity, and Polygon ranked last on it.\nThe “developer activity” here is a measure of the average amount of work that developers have been doing on any project’s public Github.

Even after its Vasil hard fork, an event likened to the Ethereum Merge, the token still continued its downward spiral to its current price of $0.2491.\nOne reason that pushed ADA’s price down is the current macroeconomic situation. During the first quarter of 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates until last month which is the seventh rate increase in 2022.\nThis in turn had adverse effects on the market, pushing the price of both traditional finance instruments and digital assets down.

According to recent news, Solana’s native token SOL has fallen so much that some are saying they are nearing collapse.\nAccording to Santiment, ADA is undervalued at the moment, showing extreme exhaustion of the bears. Twitter users who are very bullish on Cardano share metrics that are increasing. With the upcoming on-chain upgrade bringing more features on the platform, investors on ADA might see more bullish action in the coming weeks.\nWith Solana down, the NFT market is shifting from Solana to Cardano.

ADA investors and traders could see the token break through the $0.2522 price resistance.\nADA total market cap at $8.7 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com\nA break on this price resistance level could be a new sign of life to the struggling ecosystem. In the long term, investors and traders should watch for macroeconomic developments as this has a strong effect on the crypto markets.\nAs markets recover, ADA’s current price movement could be a catalyst to a stronger bullish movement.

The company’s lending arm halted customer withdrawals in November amid the downfall of FTX, and it reportedly owes users of crypto exchange Gemini’s Earn product some $900 million. Now, one of Gemini’s founders is calling out DCG’s CEO over what he calls “bad faith stall tactics.”\nGemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss tweeted an open letter to DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert on Monday, addressing what he characterized as evasive tactics by DCG and Silbert as they collectively try to resolve the situation.\nAD\nAD\nWinklevoss wrote that Gemini has repeatedly tried to work out “a consensual resolution” to the dispute with DCG and Genesis over returning funds to users, but alleged that Silbert and his companies have slow-walked the process.\n“We appreciate that there are startup costs to any restructuring, and at times things don’t go as fast as we would all like,” Winklevoss wrote. “However, it is now becoming clear that you have been engaging in bad faith stall tactics.”\nWinklevoss, who started Gemini with his twin brother Tyler, wrote that Silbert has thus far refused to “get into a room” with Gemini leadership to hash things out, along with refusing to “agree to a timeline with key milestones.”\n“After six weeks, your behavior is not only completely unacceptable, it is unconscionable,” Winklevoss added. “The idea in your head that you can quietly hide in your ivory tower and that this will all just magically go away, or that this is someone else’s problem, is pure fantasy.”\nA $1.7 billion struggle\nWinklevoss noted that DCG owes Genesis $1.675 billion, citing combined figures that Silbert shared with investors in November. That figure includes a $575 million loan due in May, plus a $1.1 billion promissory note due in June 2032 tied to the collapse of Three Arrows Capital.\nIn a tweet response, Silbert refuted the framing around the money that DCG owes to Genesis, while also claiming that DCG recently sent a proposal to both Gemini and Genesis.\nDCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis DCG has never missed an interest payment to Genesis and is current on all loans outstanding; next loan maturity is May 2023 DCG delivered to Genesis and your advisors a proposal on December 29th and has not received any response — Barry Silbert (@BarrySilbert) January 2, 2023\nAD\nAD\n“DCG did not borrow $1.675 billion from Genesis.

In a follow-up tweet, Winklevoss added, “Will you, or will you not, commit to solving this by January 8th in a manner that treats the $1.1 billion promissory note as $1.1 billion?”\nWhat is Gemini Earn?\nGemini Earn is a high-yield savings product that offers customers up to an 8% annual return on crypto deposits, depending on which assets are held. Genesis served as Gemini’s primary lending partner, and after Genesis suspended loan withdrawals in November, Gemini similarly halted withdrawals for its Earn users.\nWinklevoss pegged the total amount of money owned by Genesis to Gemini Earn customers at more than $900 million, echoing the $900 million figure reported by the Financial Times in early December. Last week, Gemini customers filed a class action suit against the company, alleging that Earn’s interest-bearing products should have been registered as securities.\nIn a November letter, Silbert attempted to reassure investors that DCG faced no imminent threat amid the industry-wide shockwaves following FTX’s collapse.

BTC fell from the $21,300 level and is now trading in the $16,600 range.\nPrior to that, BTC had been dropping gradually, pushed by the hawkish policy of the Fed Reserve. The latter kept raising interest rates in an attempt to slow down the inflation. The most recent interest rate hike took place in December. That maneuver of the U.S. central bank made Bitcoin slip from the $18,000 zone below the $17,000 level, where it has been trading since then. This hike was smaller than the previous ones, though, by 50 basis points. The Fed intends to keep pushing the interest rate up this year as well in order to tame the inflation.\nMax Keiser predicts Bitcoin at $100k this year\nOn the last day of 2022, prominent Bitcoiner Max Keiser, a former trader who hosts a Bitcoin podcast, tweeted his predictions for 2023. Among those was Bitcoin reaching $100,000, two more countries adopting BTC as legal tender, BTC becoming a major electoral issue in the U.S. elections in 2023 and a few others also about Bitcoin.\nIt turned out that Keiser shared the Bitcoin predictions for 2023 posted by El Salvador president Nayib Bukele, who legally integrated Bitcoin in El Salvador as legal tender in 2021. Actually, Bukele initially made the prediction about two other countries adopting BTC (and about BTC hitting $100,000) at the very start of 2022. Last year, however, it did not play out.\nMax Keiser had many times predicted Bitcoin to hit the $100,000 level even before this tweet. He had always set forth the classic reasons that every Bitcoin maxi cites from time to time when explaining the superiority of Bitcoin over other cryptos as they see it: BTC has a limited supply of 21 million, more than 18 million has been mined already and every four years, thanks to halving, miners produce half as much BTC as they did before."}, {"date": "2023-01-02 15:26:24", "entity": ["coin atm radar", "el salvador", "bitcoin", "el salvador", "bitcoin", "el salvador"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Australia has overtaken El Salvador to become the fourth-largest ATM hub. Australia recorded a total of 216 crypto ATM installations going into 2023.\nEl Salvador, the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender, had dropped from its position as the fourth-largest crypto ATM hub after Australia stepped up its installation game. As part of El Salvador’s campaign to make Bitcoin legal tender, the country’s president decided to install over 200 crypto ATMs across the country. At the time of this move, El Salvador became the third-largest ATM hub, after the United States and Canada, put was soon overtaken by Spain and Australia in 2022. In October 2022, Spain was reported as being the third-largest crypto ATM hub after it installed 215 ATMs.\nAustralia however deployed 99 crypto ATMs in the last three months of 2022, according to data by Coin ATM Radar – an internet analytics company that keeps track of the total number of cryptocurrency ATMs all over the world. While the United States continues to lead the charge when it comes to ATMs, Poland has also taken over El Salvador in terms of the number of crypto ATMs, having 222 of their own according to reports by Cryptopolitan. Canada and Spain remain in second and third place respectively.\nAustralia Keeps Up with Installations Despite Stricter Incoming Regulations\nThe country has taken an active effort to improve its regulation of crypto services with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese confirming this. The government down under is also set to publish a consultation paper in early 2023 to determine which digital assets will be subject to legal regulation. This proposed regulation will involve a range of activities, from the registration and licensing of crypto service providers to the implementation of AML and counter-terrorism financing measures.\nAs part of its focus on cryptocurrencies, the Australian Federal Police recently established a new crypto unit to focus on monitoring cryptocurrency-related transactions and has been set up with the goal of targeting money laundering as more criminals seek to bypass the financial system.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This is a massive win for both Polygon and Ethereum against the touted “Ethereum killer” Solana. But with MATIC stuck on an oscillating path until now, the token’s holders can’t capitalize on the growth of the ecosystem just yet.\nFor investors and traders, the current support being this strong can support any upward growth. However, any bullish momentum that can be gained can only be attained above the current resistance at $0.8157.

The “Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the taker buy volume and the taker sell volume.\nWhen the value of this metric is greater than one, it means the buy or the “long” volume is higher in the market right now. Basically, this means that there are more buyers willing to purchase BTC at a higher price currently, and thus the buying pressure is stronger.\nOn the other hand, values of the indicator under the threshold suggest the taker sell volume is more dominant at the moment. Such values imply a bearish sentiment is shared by the majority of the investors currently.\nNaturally, the ratio being exactly equal to one indicates the taker buy and taker sell volumes are exactly equal right now, and therefore the market is evenly split between bullish and bearish mentalities.\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 14-day simple moving average (SMA) Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio over the last few years:\nThe 14-day SMA value of the metric seems to be close to 1 at the moment | Source: CryptoQuant\nAs you can see in the above graph, the quant has marked the relevant points of the trend for the 14-day SMA Bitcoin taker buy/sell ratio. It looks like whenever the indicator has crossed the 1.03 level, BTC has observed some bullish momentum shortly after.\nOn the contrary, whenever the ratio dipped below the 0.97 level, a bearish trend followed the crypto’s price. The last time this signal formed was back in April 2022, before the market observed the LUNA and 3AC collapses.\nThe bullish signal was last seen in July 2022, as the crypto built up towards its first relief rally of the bear market. Since then, however, there have been no other breaches of either of these levels, as is apparent from the chart.\nIn the period between then and now, the taker buy/sell ratio has been oscillating around 1, but the metric has just not been able to summon enough momentum to go all the way in either direction. “We cannot anticipate Bitcoin to move much as long as confidence – and subsequently demand – does not return to the market,” explains the analyst.\nBTC Price\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $16,700, down 1% in the last week.\nLooks like the value of the crypto has observed a small surge in the last 24 hours | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com"}, {"date": "2023-01-02 15:00:00", "entity": ["ldo", "makerdao", "dai", "makerdao", "lido finance", "lido dao ldo", "lido finance", "tvl", "lido", "ldo", "tvl", "lido finance", "ldo", "lid ldo", "ldo"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive"], "content": "Lido Finance (LDO) is most profitable crypto of 2023 so far, here's why\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

Consequently, LDO being the governance token becomes desirable for those who want more power in the process.\nThe big gap in capitalization and TVL, as well as the opportunity to get a slice of power in the \"now biggest\" DeFi project has lifted LDO above all others in 2023.

Even countries that are not in recession, it would feel like recession for hundreds of millions of people.\n“Half of the EU will be in recession next year,” she added, going on to say that the U.S. could avoid a recession because it was “the most resilient” and could avoid a recession. “We see that the labor market remains quite strong,” Georgieva said, arguing further:\nThis is … a mixed blessing because if the labour market is very strong, the Fed may have to keep interest rates tighter for longer to bring inflation down.\nConsequently, as has already become clear at past FOMC meetings, the U.S. labor market will be a key focus for the U.S. central bank when it comes to deciding when a pivot is justified.

Clearly, Bitcoin has yet to deliver on the promise of an inflation hedge in 2022. While gold posted a YTD performance of -1%, the BTC price lost a staggering 65%.\nIt’s also a fact that Bitcoin and crypto have never traded in a recession, so historical comparables are lacking. Furthermore, it should be obvious that retail investors especially will have a hard time investing in BTC when the majority is doing badly economically.\nOn the other hand, it could be a new opportunity for Bitcoin to establish itself as the “hardest money” in the world with a maximum supply of 21 million. The question, therefore, is where will the purchasing power go in a recession? Will it be gold, as it has historically been, or will Bitcoin get a fair share as digital gold?\nAt press time, the BTC price still remained flat.

Dashjr addressed the community via a Twitter post, stating that a PGP key compromise resulted in the loss of his funds.

Such a tendency was tied to the underlying technology of transaction bookkeeping on the network. However, things might drastically change in 2023.\nThe current TVL on the network is at $50 million, down significantly from the ATH reached back in 2022, when the total value of assets on the network stayed at $350 million. Considering the lack of variety in decentralized solutions in Cardano's ecosystem, such a high number is surprising.\nIn the new year, the Cardano network will release a whole series of algorithmic stablecoins that should bring way more value to the network than decentralized exchanges or yield farming platforms, considering the convenience they bring to networks and DeFis.\nIn case of market recovery in 2023, the TVL of Cardano might reach new highs, easily beating the relatively insignificant $350 million we saw in 2022. In comparison, Solana's TVL broke the $1 billion mark back in July 2021 and reached the highest value of locked funds on the network in November, exceeding the $10 billion mark.\nObviously, the current amount of locked funds is not going to push Cardano as an ecosystem to new highs, which is why developers are betting heavily on the DeFi sector as one of the main and easiest ways to attract fresh capital to the network.\nAt press time, ADA is still struggling on the market, moving in a prolonged downtrend despite the good end of 2022 and beginning of 2023.

And as Ram Ahluwalia, CEO and co-founder of crypto-native investment advisor Lumida, pointed out in a recent thread, two new characters, Valkyrie Investments and Fir Tree have entered the “Shakespearean drama.”\nThe motivation of the second, in particular, is very dubious. Fir Tree is a hedge fund with about $3 billion in assets under management (AUM) and hundreds of holdings. The SEC 13F filings show that Fir Tree holds First Citizen’s Bank, KKR, Comcast, and hundreds of other securities. They are also large investors in oil and tobacco.\nAhluwalia, therefore, raises the question of why Fir Tree, as a value investor, has an interest in GBTC and filed a lawsuit against Grayscale in early December, especially since the hedge fund does not own a lot of GBTC.\nFir Tree Capital Management filed the lawsuit seeking information that could be used to force changes to the way the company operates its flagship Bitcoin Trust.\nThe lawsuit seeks Grayscale to lower its fees, initiate redemptions, and release documents related to its relationship with Digital Currency Group. In addition, Fir Tree also seeks to stop Grayscale’s efforts to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nA Big Short On Bitcoin, Crypto, And Tether?\nAhluwalia hypothesizes that the arguments made in the lawsuit do not reflect their true motivation. Fir Tree claims the motivation lies with the “end investors” such as “teachers, firefighters, police officers, and other public officials” who own GBTC.\n“There’s a bigger story here…Be skeptical,” says Ahluwalia, explaining, “Fir Tree is making a bigger bet against the crypto ecosystem (USDT, Bitcoin, etc.) and pushing on all the softpoints it can find.”\nIn this regard, the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) refers to Bloomberg’s revelation that Fir Tree took a large short position on Tether (USDT) in March 2022. Fir Tree is betting on a break of the USD/USDT peg, to some extent a “bank run” by March 2023.\nThe position has been structured as an “asymmetric trade,” meaning that downside risk is low and potential reward is high, with the official rationale for the trade being that “much” of the commercial paper backing the token is tied to Chinese real estate developers, some of which are in trouble.\nFurther, the analyst asserts that Fir Tree has identified three “softpoints” of the Bitcoin and crypto market that the hedge fund can rattle: Grayscale, the USDT bond, and Binance, whereas Fir Tree cannot take any action regarding the exchange, according to Ahluwalia. On GBTC, the analyst notes:\nFortunately, I don’t see a credible path to Grayscale Trust unwinding. The Trust is a cashcow and can receive a private valuation from a 3rd party purely on cashflows. What Fir Tree is doing is pushing on the loose legs of the stool.\nWith the lawsuit, Fir Tree could be trying to reduce the chances of DCG raising outside capital while its own bet still has about 3 months to run. It is also not clear from the 13F filings whether the hedge fund is also short Bitcoin or has OTM puts on BTC.\nEnemy Of My Enemy Is My Friend Dynamic\nValkyrie, even if with “heroic” intentions, does not make the situation any easier as they propose to take over the role of managing GBTC and reduce fees from 2% to 75 basis points. In addition, Valkyrie would use Reg M. Both would hurt Grayscale’s valuation.\n“My opinion is that Fir Tree is attempting to hurt the probability of a VC raise and push DCG over the edge. […] Fir Tree and Valkyrie are strange bedfellows. Fir Tree is betting against Tether. Valkyrie is positioned as the hero for Bitcoin/GBTC holders. This an ‘enemy of my enemy is my friend’ dynamic”, Ahluwalia says.\nFor Bitcoin investors, the unresolved situation around DCG and Grayscale thus remains one of the biggest potential risks for further crypto-intrinsic market turmoil.

In addition to a ruling in favor of Ripple, the community is also hoping for a settlement that could impose a penalty on Ripple but classify all present XRP sales as non-security.\nAttorney John E. Deaton, who is representing 75,000 XRP investors in the lawsuit with an amicus brief, recently put up a poll on Twitter about what outcome the community expects in 2023. Out of 18,000 votes, 59% of people said they expected a settlement between Ripple and the SEC.\nSurprisingly, Deaton has changed his mind and is among the 39% who expect a verdict by Judge Analisa Torres. As the attorney explains, he originally believed that the ominous Hinman documents were “extremely valuable” to Ripple and “extremely damaging” to the SEC.\nHinman Docs Not A Bargaining Chip For Ripple?\nRipple’s latest summary judgment letter paints a different picture. Ripple’s letter cites 4 pages of the emails, with only two redactions of words.\nPrior to reading the last two Ripple Briefs, I believed it was likely that XRP was referenced in the emails. Since ETH was getting a regulatory free pass, I believed it possible, if not likely, that someone in the Hinman speech email chain might’ve asked, “What about XRP?\nDeaton no longer holds that view. He doesn’t believe XRP was mentioned in emails, comments, or drafts any longer. If XRP itself had been mentioned in the emails, Ripple lawyers would certainly have mentioned it in the briefs, Deaton says.\nAccording to the attorney, it may have simply been a statement that simply owning a quantity of an asset or token is not enough to satisfy the common enterprise factor under Howey, despite the SEC’s assertion to the contrary.\nSince the emails and comments are probably not as damning to SEC as originally believed, and thus would defeat its entire crypto regulatory strategy, Deaton believes a settlement is no longer the most likely outcome.\nIMO, the only other reason for Gensler to settle is to avoid a ruling setting a bad precedent for the SEC as it goes against other tokens. But, tbh, I just don’t think he’s too worried about it. […] I don’t believe he’s going to settle and publicly agree that ongoing and future XRP sales, including in the secondary market, are non-securities.\nSettlement Still Possible\nHowever, another XRP community lawyer, Bill Morgan, partially disagrees with Deaton. According to the Australian, it is likely that the SEC will decide the sealing issue in his favor on procedural grounds, so Ripple will not be able to use the Hinman documents as a bargaining chip for a settlement.\nHowever, Morgan does not believe that this means there will be no settlement or that it is any less likely.

Considering all the existing drawbacks, sometimes it is indeed easier to buy CFDs or physicals instead of worrying about the safety of your assets. However, there are some opportunities that crypto gold holders can use to gain the upper hand.\nNon-stop trading schedule\nFirst of all, decentralization allows blockchain-based assets to be traded 24 hours without any stops or servicing hours. Assets are available for every investor on numerous trading platforms. Technical analysts who mostly trade cryptocurrencies prefer decentralized assets for higher accuracy of indicators, thanks to the continuous exchange process.\nApart from convenience, around-the-clock trading makes technical indicators behave differently and they provide way more data. Moving averages, for example, have more data to work with, which leads to the formation of patterns that we would not see on a CFD trading pair.\nGolden cross\nThanks to the aforementioned reasons, we can see a strong technical signal on blockchain-based gold that is only yet to happen on a CFD. The golden cross between 200 and 50 moving averages happened on PAXG back in the beginning of December 2022, while it is only about to happen now on a CFD pair.\nUnfortunately, the independence of crypto gold is questionable, considering the imbalance between the trading volumes and liquidity on the two assets.

Nevertheless, we can identify potential contenders that are capitalizing on current developments, such as decentralized finance and digital payment solutions.\nThe cryptocurrency market started 2023 with the prolonged unfavorable conditions that have characterized the industry over the past year continuing in place.\nYet, despite the gloomy economic environment, a number of digital assets stand out as having the ability to make impressive gains.\nHere are the top five cryptocurrencies that could experience a substantial bull run:\n1. Ethereum (ETH)\nDespite the fact that Ethereum has likely passed the threshold where it can increase by 5,000%, it still has significant potential for expansion. It was the first blockchain to feature smart contracts, which can be used by developers to build decentralized applications (dApps).\nETH has been unable to perform well over the previous several months and has been controlled by bears. However, as we usher in 2023, we may witness significant changes in the Ethereum blockchain and its network, which will likely have a beneficial impact on ETH values.\nIn September 2022, Ethereum completed its long-awaited Merge to a proof-of-stake mechanism, dramatically boosting its energy efficiency. The improvement could be a crucial component in improving Ethereum’s value this year and drawing in additional investors.\n2. XRP\nSince its inception, the XRP ecosystem has always been dynamic. XRP began trading at $0.00268621 on May 22, 2014 and has increased by a whopping 12727% over the past eight years.\nXRP is trading at $0.3444 as of this writing, down 1.8% in the past week, according to data from CoinMarketCap.\nBased on the current price movement of the currency, several analysts have cautioned that if XRP fails to surpass the $0.40 level of resistance, the asset might likely decline further.\nBut, XRP has demonstrated positive sentiments following minor victories in the ongoing litigation between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n3. SushiSwap (SUSHI)\nIn 2021, automated market makers, which are decentralized exchanges based on smart contracts, expanded significantly. Although there are other AMMs available, SushiSwap (SUSHI) may be the one best positioned for a significant breakout.\nSushiSwap is preferable to other AMMs such as Uniswap (UNI) and PancakeSwap (CAKE) because the SUSHI app offers perhaps the most user-friendly experience, while having a fraction of the market capitalization of its two top rivals.\nCoingecko data reveals that SUSHI is currently trading at $0.9678, up 4.0% over the past seven days.\nAccording to some analysts, SUSHI is predicted to surpass an average price level of $1.43 in 2023, while its expected minimum price value by the end of this year is $1.38.\nCrypto total market cap at $766 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com\n4. Bitcoin (BTC)\nThe leading cryptocurrency is still consolidating, having declined by more than 70% from its all-time high of nearly $69,000. Although price forecasts show that BTC will continue to correct this month and trade around $15,500, it is likely that the price will continue to decline.\nIn addition, there are indications that Bitcoin may be poised for a further rebound, as numbers show that despite BTC’s contraction, the asset has registered a speedier recovery post-FTX fiasco than it did following past deflation episodes.\nAccording to Coingecko, BTC is currently trading at $16,728, a decrease of 0.7% in the last seven days.\n5. Shiba Inu (SHIB)\nEven though Dogecoin was the first meme coin to join the cryptocurrency market, it now faces significant competition. In this light, Shiba Inu is likely one of the top cryptocurrencies for people looking to diversify their portfolio with other meme coins.\nThe history of the Shiba Inu is nothing less than remarkable. Even though the project was only introduced in April 2020, it has already evolved into a crypto asset with a huge market capitalization. In addition, early investors have seen returns of several million percentage points since then.\nAccording to statistics from CoinMarketCap, SHIB is trading at $0.00000824, a gain of 2.3% over the past 24 hours.\n–\nFeatured image: Futurist Speaker"}, {"date": "2023-01-02 10:10:00", "entity": ["shibburn", "u.", "shib", "floki inu", "nft", "valhalla", "binance exchange", "bnb", "shib army", "shib", "meme coins", "shiba", "babydoge"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

While daily burns of this popular meme token have been pretty low since the fall of last year, during the first two days of 2023 they were comparable to the big burns in 2022.\nHere's how much SHIB has been destroyed so far over the last two days with the burn rate jumping high.\nWhat are token burns about?\nThe so-called \"burning\" of crypto, in fact, means a permanent extraction of coins from the circulating supply. By reducing the amount of tokens that circulate in the market, communities try to make their beloved coins more scarce. This gives them a shade of a chance that the price of the asset they burn will spike in the future.\nBurning is especially popular with meme coins — Shiba Inu, BabyDoge in particular, Floki Inu has also announced the start of upcoming massive burns via their recently launched NFT metaverse game Valhalla. The Binance exchange also regularly reduces their supply of BNB by burning those tokens, i.e., sending them to wallets from which any withdrawals are impossible. They are known as \"dead\" or \"unspendable\" wallets.\nIn the past 24 hours, there have been a total of 159,411,895 $SHIB tokens burned and 13 transactions.

On Jan. 1, 90,098,748 meme coins was sent to \"inferno\" wallets, taking nine transactions to achieve that. On Jan. 2 so far, they have managed to remove a total of 159,411,895 SHIB from circulation, which took 13 transactions to dead wallets.\nThe majority of the latter amount of SHIB was burned in a single transfer as a total of 147,941,583 meme coins was burned by an anonymous address 0x0f10a3c90e73feaadd6d0d4bda302891160d0f24. This latest burn has pushed the overall SHIB burn rate up by 115.6%.\nImage via Shibburn\nOverall, as reported by U.Today earlier, over the last year, the SHIB army destroyed 83,347,071,504 Shiba Inu in total."}, {"date": "2023-01-02 09:12:00", "entity": ["cardano", "vasil", "milkomeda c1", "cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "iog", "cardano", "snoop dogg", "champ medici", "##omeda c1", "ethereum", "cardano", "milkomeda", "cardano", "c1", "cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "input output global", "vasil plutus", "cardano", "vasil", "binance", "coinbase", "upbit", "xt. com", "cardano", "ethereum", "cardano", "ethereum", "milkomeda c1", "cardano", "dappradar", "cardano", "cardano", "dappradar", "jpg", "cardano", "miniswap", "cardano", "vasil", "cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "nft", "cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "lithu"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The year 2022 was kaleidoscopically eventful for the Cardano ecosystem, with the Vasil update, the launch of EVM-compatible Milkomeda C1 and many more significant achievements. U.Today has summed up the top five things Cardano accomplished throughout the outgoing year.\nCardano’s Happy Vasil Day\nNo words can describe how much awaited the Vasil hardfork was for the Cardano community. Finally, after months of preparation and both the IOG and Cardano teams working around the clock, the historic upgrade went live on Sept. 22 at 9:44 p.m. UTC. Vasil introduced Plutus 2.0, a new version of Cardano's native smart contract language, which made smart contracts more efficient and cost effective. Later on, the Vasil upgrade was implemented by such major crypto exchanges as Binance, Coinbase, Upbit, XT.com and many more, thus bringing utility to the blockchain.\n“Pivotal moment”: Cardano now supports Ethereum dApps\nThe next milestone for Cardano in 2022 was achieving compatibility with Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), thanks to the launch of Milkomeda C1, a sidechain connected directly to Cardano. Milkomeda C1 allows users to seamlessly move assets between the two blockchains, making it possible to run popular Ethereum-based dApps on top of Cardano. This is accomplished with the wrapped smart contract technology pioneered by Milkomeda. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson called the launch of the C1 Layer-2 solution “a great development” for Cardano.\nCardano ecosystem onboards over 1,000 dApps\nAnother milestone Cardano can pride itself on this year is the number of onboarded dApps to its smart contracts. According to a thread shared by the Input Output Global (IOG) team in June, there are over 1,000 projects building on Cardano, and the number continues to grow. The main sphere of Cardano’s focus is NFT: 40.2% of protocols belong to the \"NFT collections\" category, while over 4% are marketplaces for NFTs. The top five active protocols also include community apps and social media platforms, developer instruments, gaming platforms and metaverses. This milestone allowed Cardano to break into the leaderboard of smart contracts platforms for dApps.\nCardano comes to world's biggest dApp store\nIn early September , Cardano blockchain received support from Lithuania-based service DappRadar. In its announcement tweet, the world’s biggest dApp store invited developers who are working on Cardano to submit their contracts. Among the top-ranked Cardano dApps on DappRadar at the moment are JPG Store, leading Cardano NFT marketplace, MuesliSwap and Miniswap, Cardano’s decentralized exchanges. This event might not be as significant and impressive as the Vasil upgrade, but what seems to be a small step for one blockchain might be a giant leap for another, as this was the first time Cardano apps started to be added to large external trackers.\nSnoop Dogg and Champ Medici popularizing Cardano"}, {"date": "2023-01-02 09:08:35", "entity": ["shiba inu", "twitter", "shib", "kusama", "shiba", "telegram", "kusama", "u.", "kusama", "unification foundation", "shibarium", "shiba", "shibarium", "meme coin", "kusama", "shib"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "The Shiba Inu community should expect “some surprises,” according to lead developer Shytoshi Kusama\nIn a message recently posted on Telegram, lead developer Shytoshi Kusama said that “everything is near,” referring to upcoming releases.\nNotably, Kusama also teased the community with “some surprises” without going further into detail.\nAs reported by U.Today , Kusama recently had a meeting with developers from the Unification Foundation regarding Shibarium.\nThe Shiba Inu community has been eagerly waiting for the launch of Shibarium since it was first announced.\nStill, members were disappointed earlier this month when a “special countdown” tweet from Shiba Inu’s official Twitter account did not result in any major news about the layer-2 solution.\nFor now, it appears as though testing has almost reached completion on these highly anticipated updates.

With 2022 coming off as the year that saw the collapse of many top crypto firms, including Celsius Network, Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX Derivatives Exchange, LTC closed the year down with a loss of 50.9%.\nWhile this may be tagged as poor performance, the truth remains that Litecoin outperformed the majority of the coins in the top 10 by market capitalization profiled by CoinMarketCap. With this stellar start, expectations on LTC remain high, and more than 800,000 traders have placed it on their watch lists to track its performance for the rest of the year.\nGrowing Litecoin utility\nLitecoin was designed to serve as a unique payment token, and its purpose in this regard has continued to enjoin massive expansion.

Within 45 minutes, the price dropped from $0.3394 to $0.2998, meaning that XRP experienced a drop of a whopping 12%.\nRemarkably, this move did not happen in line with the broader market sentiment, as BTC and ETH recorded small gains in the meantime. It’s also worth noting that the sudden price drop seemingly happened without any real news related to Ripple, such as a new development in the legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, or the XRP token. Thus, the price move seems mostly influenced by speculation.\nHowever, at press time, the price had already managed to bounce back to $0.3322, erasing much of the sudden price loss.

It’s just my sense based on data, experience and maybe just feelings.\nMore Downside In Store For The XRP Price?\nToday’s move could spell more downside for the price. The recent rejection at the key $0.37 resistance is likely to play a role in this. On the upside, it would be of significant importance for investors if XRP recaptures the level at $0.343 relatively soon. Otherwise, there could be a lot of liquidity on the downside, as today’s move also showed.\nLooking at the 1-day chart, a retest of the level at $0.2641 would be the most bearish scenario for now. The price level might present massive support, where liquidity could already kick in.\nInvestors should keep an eye on the $0.3205 level for now.

On-chain transactional data reveal that a portion of the funds were exchanged for USDT while the remainder was routed to a mixing service.\nMeanwhile, other charges surfaced saying that Bankman-Fried conducted new transactions via which he ultimately cashed out about $700,00 worth of cryptocurrency.\nFederal Prosecutors Expected To Investigate\nBloomberg reports that these unusual transactions have caught the attention of federal prosecutors in the United States, who plan to launch an inquiry.\nAuthorities in the Southern District of New York, who only last month filed criminal charges against Bankman-Fried for his involvement in the collapse of FTX, are trying to figure out who is handling the assets in question.\nCrypto total market cap at $764 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com\nEvery day, the never-ending FTX controversy takes a new turn, and the most recent transfer of assets to scavenge whatever is left in those cryptocurrency wallets is concerning for the community.\nThe terms of Sam Bankman-Fried’s bail prohibit him from engaging in financial transactions over $1,000 without the court’s permission.\nBloomberg claimed that around $372 million worth of tokens were taken from the exchange hours after FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11, citing bankruptcy records.\nSam Bankman-Fried, known as the “King Of Crypto,” has claimed that he has approximately $100,000 left in his bank account, despite previously being described as a billionaire.\nHe is currently under house arrest at his parents’ home in California with an electronic monitor strapped around his ankle.\n–\nFeatured image: Euronews"}, {"date": "2023-01-02 07:59:00", "entity": ["bitcoin", "bitcoin", "fed", "government", "burry", "s & p 500", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto.\nRelated Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Blofin\nIn the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.\nSpilotro: “As a nascent technology, crypto hasn’t been as susceptive to rate cycling in the past. But as it has become a bigger part of the financial system, it now follows by that system’s rules more than the community might like.”\nWe close this series with an in-house guest, our Editorial Director, Tony Spilotro. Dedicated to spreading knowledge and tools for anyone willing to listen, Tony keeps tabs on the market by promoting critical thinking, going against the crowd, and developing a methodical approach to trading.\nSpilotro: “I am confident the mainstream media has it horribly wrong. In fact, the “magazine cover indicator” is one of the most proven ways to pick tops and bottoms in the stock market.”\nTony is a proponent of the Elliot Wave Theory, which has perfectly described Bitcoin and crypto’s price trajectory since the early 2010s. The market is about to take a critical path, but in which direction? This is what he told us:\nQ: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid?\nA: The biggest difference today versus then are the macro conditions and money flow. The Fed tightening did its trick, taking the bull by the horns so to speak. Ned Davis Research had a rule, “Don’t Fight The Fed” and it was proven true over the last year plus. As a nascent technology, crypto hasn’t been as susceptive to rate cycling in the past. But as it has become a bigger part of the financial system, it now follows by that system’s rules more than the community might like. The industry was hurt badly by the domino-effect over the last several months, heightened by the LUNA collapse and FTX fiasco. But Bitcoin and some other cryptocurrencies feel fundamentally strong. Given how rough it is out there for many stocks, how well such a speculative asset class is holding up is remarkable. My belief in Bitcoin isn’t shaken, but like anything, will continue to have its ebbs and flows of investor enthusiasm.\nQ: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision?\nA: For me, time drives the narratives. The market will find a narrative when the time is right. The last narrative was Bitcoin as an inflation hedge and it performed horribly during the highest inflation in years. Narratives are very often false – but we all fall for it again and again. The next narrative will likely be overly-euphoric and result in its eventual destruction when the sentiment tide turns. I once again turn to a few things. Crypto is a nascent technology where we’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible. Even the internet is early in its design compared to the highway system or railroads. Crypto is a newborn by comparison. Much like the internet before it, when people don’t understand it fully, it is easier to fall victim to greater market sentiment and narratives. The dot com bubble is a great example. Much like all the other times Bitcoin was claimed dead, its doing nothing more than shaking out the non-believers and sucking up those that are ready to believe. Sadly, I don’t think there is a financial utopia ahead, rather Bitcoin becomes our best bet retaining ownership rights over value. I think it becomes the digital version of money in the mattress.\nQ: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right?\nA: The most significant moment for crypto in 2022 had to be the FTX situation, although one might argue that would never have occurred without the LUNA collapse preceding it. I think the industry heavily feels the impact of the fallout for the next years and beyond. Sweeping regulation should occur, wiping out many shitcoins from existence. Rules will be put in place so no business can raise capital a’la FTT tokens. Some innovation will stifle, especially around DeFi and Ethereum. Scarcity and stronger network usage fundamentals will decouple from the rest of crypto. I am confident the mainstream media has it horribly wrong. In fact, the “magazine cover indicator” is one of the most proven ways to pick tops and bottoms in the stock market. When mainstream media starts reporting on it heavily, an extreme in sentiment is usually here.\nQ: What has been the best indicator to watch in 2022, and what indicators are you keeping track of for 2023? We know you based a lot of your analysis on the Elliot Wave theory; what can market participants expect next year according to this theory?\nA: The best indicator for 2022 was the weekly Ichimoku cloud. The moment BTCUSD fell out of the Ichimoku cloud, it was lights out for bulls and a deep decline followed. Granted, this happened after Bitcoin had fallen some in value – it was the confirmation that the bull run was finished for some time. I should have given this more weight, especially after seeing how Bitcoin behaved after losing the cloud back in March of 2020. Elliott Wave Theory matches price patterns the crowd isn’t often looking for – such as zig-zags or flats — with price extremes, and, more importantly, sentiment extremes.\nI’m a big contrarian in general, and I go by the nickname Tony “The Bull” so I lean bullish on BTC overall. If the crowd is bearish, I feel safer being bullish and vice versa. That said, I’m bullish on BTC for one last rally. I’ve been building the last 1-2 years of positions in anticipation of what I believe will be a shocking wave 5 for Bitcoin and the total crypto market cap.\nJust when everyone turns bullish once again, and we’ve made ridiculous new highs, I’ll temporarily retire Tony “The Bull” and turn to the biggest bear in crypto –because this is what I believe to be the grand finale for some time."}, {"date": "2023-01-01 16:54:38", "entity": ["bitcoin", "bitcoin", "draper", "bitcoin", "digital currencies", "bitcoin", "bitcoins", "marshals service", "##per", "bitcoin", "u.", "bitcoin", "skype", "tesla"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Tim Draper believes that the largest cryptocurrency will eventually reach the much-coveted milestone\nTech mogul Tim Draper has recently addressed his oft-repeated prediction about Bitcoin reaching $250,000 by 2023.\nWhile the cryptocurrency hasn't made it that high yet, he is still optimistic that this prediction will come true before the upcoming halvening.\nThe billionaire venture capitalist and crypto enthusiast revealed that he wore a T-shirt with the slogan \"250K by 2022\" illustrating his faith in the digital currency.\nHalvening is an event that rewards those who mine Bitcoin with fewer coins than before, adding to the cryptocurerncy's scarcity.

Almost every industry is looking to take advantage of IoT and the world is well set for that to happen. These days, almost everyone owns a smartphone or tablet device, and a great many machines are equipped with Wi-Fi enabled sensors that can send data to a centralized server. Things like factory machines, traffic lights, airplanes - you name it, they all have the ability to talk to one another thanks to IoT.\nHowever, the rise of IoT may present some problems. With so many devices in the world all collecting, sending, receiving and processing data, existing networks will soon become clogged, resulting in very high costs for compute and storage power.\nThis is why blockchain is often touted as an ideal platform for IoT devices. With blockchain, data is stored on a distributed, decentralized ledger that’s hosted on multiple nodes. Its immutable nature means that the data stored within it cannot be corrupted. The merger of blockchain and IoT results in a reliable and secure method of storing that’s generated and processed by intelligent devices. Moreover, because it’s decentralized, there’s no need for centralized control, management and maintenance, and no expensive costs associated with it.\nHow Blockchain Benefits IoT\nGiven the advantages, it’s no surprise that blockchain and IoT have already made considerable progress. In 2019, almost 20% of all IoT deployments were powered by blockchain solutions, according to data from International Data Corp. There’s lots of room for potential growth in this area too, with Statista estimating the total installed base of IoT devices to exceed 75 billion by the end of 2025.\nThe growth of IoT will result in enormous volumes of data being generated, and dealing with all of that information is likely going to be a daunting challenge if we continue to rely on conventional cloud-based networks. For one thing there’s the enormous costs to consider. Today’s cloud networks can be extremely costly in terms of storage and processing power.\nThe issue is that existing IoT ecosystems are powered by a highly centralized, brokered communication model based on a client/server architecture. Within this infrastructure, each device is identified, connected and authenticated by cloud servers that use massive amounts of storage and processing power at extremely high costs.\nAnother issue with cloud networks is the risk of outages, which can cause data to become inaccessible and sometimes even lost forever.\nProponents of blockchain for IoT say decentralized networks will make it simpler to track billions of devices, enabling distributed processing and coordination at much lower costs. By adopting a standardized, peer-to-peer communication model to process large volumes of transactions between connected devices, companies will no longer need to rely on cloud servers.\nFurthermore, blockchain will eliminate single points of failure, which is a big problem with today’s centralized cloud networks. Blockchain is incredibly secure too, thanks to its use of cryptography to secure the data it collects.\nProblems To Overcome\nIt won’t all be plain sailing if we’re to migrate IoT workloads to a blockchain-based infrastructure. There are some key issues that need to be overcome, but luckily a number of interesting solutions are already being built.\nOne of the main challenges with blockchain is that it’s not a low-latency protocol. As such, most blockchains process a very low number of transactions per second, and that presents issues for large-scale IoT device networks, as these require extremely rapid rates of data transfer to keep up. Ethereum, the world’s most popular smart contract blockchain, is only capable of processing around seven transactions per second, for example. Moreover, the Ethereum network is often congested, leading to high transaction costs. In its natural state, it’s not a realistic platform for large-scale IoT deployments.\nThe answer to this problem may lie in scaling solutions like Boba Network, which is a Layer-2 network and hybrid compute platform that powers lightning fast transactions with much lower costs than traditional Layer-1 networks.\nBoba Network relies on a technology called optimistic rollups, which enable multiple transactions to be bundled into one and processed simultaneously. In this way, transactions are not only performed more quickly, but are more cost-effective too, as the gas fees for each bundle are split between them. What’s more, Boba Network’s hybrid compute technology makes it a perfect fit for IoT data, as it enables Ethereum smart contracts to talk to any external Web2 API or sensor to collect and process real-world information.\nA second problem that needs to be solved is blockchain’s compatibility issues. SQL datasets have emerged as the standard for IoT networks, but blockchain is not well suited for use as a traditional database as it stores data differently, in blocks, as opposed to rows and columns. Its distributed nature is also not compatible with SQL-type databases. Still, there are some promising projects working to fix these compatibility issues. IOTA, for instance, has developed an IoT compatible blockchain that relies on a Directed Acyclic Graph-based tangle structure, as opposed to standard blocks. This makes it more suited for storing the kind of chronologically-ordered data created by IoT devices.\nIoT Blockchain Applications At Work\nThe combination of blockchain and IoT is an extremely powerful one for many specific application use cases. One of the best examples is in logistics, which is the backbone of most global industries, ensuring that raw materials and finished products are always in stock, and get where they need to go.\nThe logistics and supply chain industries face numerous challenges, including too much paperwork, lack of control over shipping, issues around traceability, transportation difficulties and more.\nIoT and blockchain together can fix many of these issues. For instance, they can combine to collect and store data on things such as locations, times of departure and arrival, the temperature of goods in transit, the status of containers being shipped and so on. Because blockchain is decentralized and immutable, anyone can access this data at any time and be sure that it hasn’t been corrupted.\nOne company doing this is Ambrosus, the creator of a blockchain-powered IoT network for the pharmaceutical and food logistics industries. It relies on a network of blockchain-connected sensors to provide full visibility into goods throughout the supply chain, leading to faster and more efficient movement of these goods.\nConnected cars are another obvious example of how blockchain and IoT can be utilized together. Car manufacturers are increasingly turning to IoT enabled sensors to develop automated vehicles, and the addition of blockchain creates many new possibilities for the industry around smart parking, automated traffic control and more. Take NetObjex, which has created a smart parking solution that’s powered by IoT and blockchain. Through its collaboration with PNI, which designs smart parking sensors, it has created a platform for autonomous vehicles to quickly find an available parking spot with integrated payments using cryptocurrency.\nLast but not least is the energy sector, which has already enjoyed the benefits of IoT enabled sensors that led to the creation of so-called smart meters. When IoT is merged with blockchain, smart meters can upload data in real-time and enable better distribution of energy across the grid. A home equipped with solar panels for instance can provide surplus power back to the grid, reducing energy wastage. An example of how this works can be found in Brooklyn, New York. There, solar powered homes are connected through so-called “microgrids” that enable smart meters to talk to one another across a distributed network. Through this network, these homes now have a way to buy and sell electricity from one another, with the blockchain facilitating transactions and ensuring everyone can save money on their energy bills.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Most of these hacks were on DeFi platforms which saw a third of all such activity in the last year.\nWhile certain crypto and DeFi platforms have contributed the most disruptive technology to finance and other industrial sectors, platforms have been exploited due to the nascent state of the code that they have deployed.\nMany would argue that crypto is basically a testing ground for what might prove to be the most innovative technology, the scale of which could compare with the internet and the dotcom era that began on top of it.\nHowever, 2022 has been a particularly tough year for this technology, and fraudulent activity and hacks have abounded. According to an article on Forbes, more than $3 billion in value was misappropriated. The following are 8 of the biggest hacks:\nRonin Network: $625 million - Hackers stole over $625 million worth of ether and USD coin from the Ronin Network, a blockchain for the Axie Infinity video game. The U.S. Treasury Department later linked the heist to North Korean state-backed hacking group Lazarus Group.\nWormhole Network: $325 million - On February 2, an unknown hacker exploited a vulnerability in the Wormhole Network, a protocol that allows users to move cryptocurrencies and NFTs between different blockchains. The attacker created 120,000 wETH (worth around $325 million) without putting up the necessary collateral. Jump Crypto, the parent company of Wormhole, later replaced the stolen funds.\nNomad: $190 million - A hacker exploited a weakness in Nomad's code to steal approximately $190 million in tokens on August 1. Dozens of copycats joined the heist. Nomad was able to recover over $20 million after pleading with users to return the funds.\nBeanstalk Farms: $182 million - In April, an attacker drained over $150 million in crypto from Beanstalk Farms, a stablecoin project based on Ethereum. The hacker used a flash loan from the Aave protocol to borrow nearly $1 billion in crypto and gain a 67% voting stake in Beanstalk. With this supermajority, the hacker was able to transfer the Beanstalk tokens to their own wallet.\nWintermute: $160 million - The London-based crypto market maker lost $160 million in a September 20 hack. It is believed that hackers used brute-force computing to generate all the possible passwords to a company vanity address.\nMango Markets: $112 million - Avraham Eisenberg held $112 million worth of tokens in ransom to force Mango Markets, a decentralised crypto exchange, to finance bad debt. Eisenberg used two accounts on the platform to take large positions in perpetual futures on the dollar-pegged USD coin, causing its price to spike tenfold on other decentralised exchanges. He then used the profit to borrow and withdraw a number of tokens from Mango.\nBNB Smart Chain XCN2: $110 million - Hackers stole an estimated $110 million from the Binance-affiliated BSC Token Hub on October 6. Binance blamed the hack on a \"flash loan exploit\" and later recovered the stolen funds.\nHarmony Horizon Bridge: $100 million - There were concerns about the bridge even before it was hacked for $100 million in various cryptocurrencies in June of 2022, given that the small number of validators for its multi-sig wallet left it vulnerable to attack.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

By the end of 2022, this amount would fall below $800 billion. Therefore, this shows a great deal about the events of the period.\nAs 2022 comes to a close, we take a quick look at the five best-performing cryptocurrencies of the year.\nTop 5 Crypto: Ethereum (ETH) – Market Cap: $148 Billion\nAfter outpacing bitcoin by more than 350% in 2021, Ethereum (ETH) ranked tenth among cryptocurrencies in 2022, losing just under 70% of its value.\nAmong investors and cryptocurrency aficionados, Ethereum stands out as the most well-known altcoin because it is more than just another cryptocurrency. And despite a difficult first half of the year, experts believe that by 2022 it will be back above $3,000.\nAccording to data from Coingecko, ETH was trading at $1,194 at the time of writing, a decrease of 2.2% over the past week.\nBitcoin (BTC) – Market Cap: $323 Billion\nEven if it did better than some of its lesser peers, the most valuable and largest cryptocurrency in the world was not able to avoid the market crash of 2022.\nAs Bitcoin’s popularity has grown, so has its value. In May 2016, one Bitcoin cost approximately $500. As of December 20, 2022, one BTC was valued at approximately $16,795. That is an increase of nearly 3,260%.\nBitcoin is down 76% from its peak of $68,787 in November 2021. According to CoinMarketCap, the current price of Bitcoin is $16,523, a decrease of roughly 2.0% over the past week.\nTether (USDT) – Market Cap: $66 Billion\nTether (USDT) is a stablecoin, meaning that it is backed by fiat currencies such as U.S. dollars and the Euro and theoretically maintains a value equal to one of those denominations.\nThe algorithm-based projection website Wallet Investor predicted, as of 1 December 2022, that the USDT price will remain mainly tied to the US dollar during the next half decade.\nTheoretically, Tether’s value should be more stable than other cryptocurrencies, and investors who anticipate the severe volatility of other coins appreciate it.\nCrypto total market cap at $755 billion on the daily chart | Chart: TradingView.com\nDogecoin (DOGE) – Market Cap: $9.8 Billion\nBeginning in the second quarter, the original “meme” coin joined the rest of the cryptocurrency market in a major sell-off. In 2022, Dogecoin performed better than most other tokens.\nDOGE is the third-best performer in the top 10, with a decline of just over 50% this year, second only to XRP, which experienced a decline of 54%.\nThe joke currency has outperformed most others in large part because of Elon Musk’s deal to acquire Twitter, with advocates of the coin thinking this acquisition could improve the price of DOGE, which is now trading at $0.0697, down 10% in the last seven days.\nCardano (ADA) – Market Cap: $9 Billion\nThe Cardano ADA token has shown modest growth compared to other major cryptocurrencies. In 2017, ADA cost $0.02 per coin. As of December 20, 2022, it cost $0.26. This is a 1,188% growth.\nSome analysts project that the value of ADA will climb by around 256% between the end of 2022 and the end of 2025. Then, between 2025 and 2030, the cryptocurrency is anticipated to expand by an additional 206%.\nThe true value that the blockchain provides to its users will increase as its speed and efficiency improve, and as a result, the value of ADA should increase as well.\n–\nFeatured image: FXVNPRo"}, {"date": "2023-01-01 10:54:00", "entity": ["##meda research", "solana", "altcoins", "venezuelan banking", "sudeban", "wazirx", "ftx", "alameda", "alameda", "alameda research", "ftx", "bit fiji", "messari", "gemini", "3commas", "apple pay", "google pay", "jpmorgan", "crypto. com", "stablecoins", "btc", "microstrategy", "bitcoin", "cardano", "stablecoin", "bmw", "bnb chain", "coinweb", "business gemini", "crypto exchange", "founders", "tyler", "##voss", "microstrategy", "btc", "als research", "protonmail", "bitcoin", "valkyrie investments", "bitcoin trust", "midas", "ftx", "fbi", "ftx", "fidelity investments metaverse", "kraken", "ftx", "binance france"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "After Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison entered into a plea deal for leniency in her own case, Sam Bankman-Fried is set to plead out himself.

According to his rhetoric, by 2024, the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy of raising interest rates will lead to the collapse of many sectors like real estate and a drop in personal income.\nAs a conclusion, Robert Kiyosaki once again stresses that only the smart and informed will get rich under such circumstances."}, {"date": "2023-01-01 10:00:00", "entity": ["hm revenue"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "“This exemption is an important factor in attracting global investors, meaning foreign investors won’t be brought into U.K. tax simply by appointing U.K.-based investment managers,” the government's tax arm, the HM Revenue and Customs, said in an email to CoinDesk. “To build upon the U.K.’s position as an investment management hub, this exemption has been extended to include crypto assets, so that funds which include them aren’t put off from appointing U.K. managers.”"}, {"date": "2023-01-01 09:55:00", "entity": ["shiba", "meme", "shiba inu", "meme token", "shiba", "inu", "shiba inu", "shibburn", "shiba", "shiba inu"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

Obviously, one would expect extremely low to non-existent volume of Shiba Inu, hence a lack of burning volume on the chain. However, that was not the case on Dec. 31 and Jan. 1.\nAccording to the Shibburn portal, almost 100 million Shiba Inu tokens have been burned in the last 24 hours. In the last 48 hours, the number is way more significant, with almost 300 million Shiba Inu tokens burned in one transaction only.\nDespite the deceleration of burning activities on the network, Shiba Inu still manages to maintain a certain threshold in the overall amount of burned assets, which leads to a gradual reduction in the circulating supply. When the network's activity is on a high level, investors manage to burn up to 1 billion SHIB tokens, significantly helping the token's performance on the market.\nDespite the existing burn and the gradual removal of SHIB from the market, the price of the meme token has been struggling throughout 2022 for numerous reasons: the general downtrend on the cryptocurrency market, massive de-risking of investors' portfolios and the lack of clarity in Shiba Inu's future.\nFrom the market perspective, Shiba Inu lost more than 90% of its value since reaching the all-time high back in 2021, which makes it one of the worst-performing assets across the market.\nThe current holder composition suggests that short-term traders are no longer interested in the meme coin, which explains the lack of buying volume on the asset.

This promise was coupled with huge referral bonuses for bringing in other investors into what is now being revealed as large-scale fraud network.\nSouth Korean regulators, who have been clamping down on crypto exchanges for some time now, declared that V Global had misused its customers' funds. South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), the country's integrated financial regulator, has warned investors to be wary of any suspicious investment proposals in the future, especially those promising abnormally high rewards.\nThe South Korean government's arrest of V Global's executives did not result into imprisonment for all of them, however. Of the six, three were not detained after claiming innocence and are still open to appeal for their charges while under a five-year probation. The other three have received prison sentences of between three years up to a maximum of eight years.\nThe fraudulent crypto exchange, which at the height of its operations between July 2020 to April 2021, attracted roughly 50,000 investors by promising them immense returns of up to 300% APY on investments.\n“The defendants only trusted the VGlobal management team, evaded responsibility, and once the investigation began, they destroyed evidence and interfered with the investigation,” the judge of the 12th Criminal Division of the Suwon District Court stated.\nAccording to Korean media reports, however, the judge gave some degree of leniency to the defendants, given that further investigations revealed the scale of the fraud operation to be much less than previous estimates. These executives now join the firm's former CEO aliased as \"Mr. Lee\" who is now serving a 22-year prison term after being sentenced in February 2022.\nEarlier reports from Korean media outfit Kyeongin detail how roughly 10,000 investors from the exchange were actually able to see significant returns. These were, however, only made from the multilevel marketing schemes for recruiting other investors into the network. In June of 2022, the firm paid out \"referral bonuses\" worth $1,000 to each of its clients, suggesting that its operation indeed mirrored that of a Ponzi scheme.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Take a look at the most intriguing pieces of news presented to you by U.Today in 2022; perhaps they will shed some light onto this mystery.\nDid Satoshi Nakamoto meet with SEC five years ago?\nBack in September , Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett obtained a copy of the public calendar of Bill Hinman, former director of the SEC. Judging from the calendar's contents, on Aug. 23, 2017 Hinman had a meeting with venture capitalist Tim Draper, Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto and SEC official Valerie Szczepanik. It would appear that Draper and both SEC representatives found out who Satoshi really is, but three days later, Draper tweeted that he was targeted by a “convincing” Satoshi impostor, complaining that the latter wasted a lot of his time.\nRipple CTO says he could have been part of \"Satoshi\"\nWhile writing a thread on Craig Wright’s lawsuit, Ripple CTO David Schwartz commented that he could have been a part of “Satoshi” — a group of people who created Bitcoin. Back in 2020, he stated that given the difficulty and skill-demand of Bitcoin creation, it might have required the participation of a group of people, not just one individual. Schwartz believes that he could accomplish almost everything Satoshi did. Unfortunately, stated the Ripple CTO , he did not find out about the world's largest cryptocurrency until 2011.\nLegal battles of self-proclaimed Satoshi Craig Wright: one defeat and one Pyrrhic win\nOn March 25, 2022, Craig Wright’s controversial lawsuit stemming from 2020 finally came to an end , and not in his favor. The High Court of Justice rejected the lawsuit in which Wright claimed that the private keys to his wallet holding 80,000 BTC were stolen by hackers and, thus, Bitcoin developers must grant him access to the said wallet as they owe him fiduciary duties. However, Judge Falk ruled that self-proclaimed Satoshi has no legal ground to sue core BTC devs.\nHowever, the 2019 lawsuit against podcaster Peter McCormack ended up being a “win”: Craig Wright was given £1 in damages. The legal battle started after McCormack called the self-proclaimed Satoshi a fraud, which Wright considered defamation. Interestingly, Wright was suing for $122,000, but Judge Chamberlain only awarded nominal damages after it turned out that key parts of Wright’s evidence were false, such as being uninvited from academic conferences because of McCormack.\nSatoshi’s identity might have been revealed by Martin Shkreli\nTwo weeks ago, on Dec. 13, biotech entrepreneur Martin Shkreli shared a Substack post, in which he stated that he might have discovered the real identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Shkreli alleges that Paul Le Roux, a former programmer and former criminal cartel boss, has been hiding behind the mask of the Bitcoin creator all this time. To prove his point, Shkreli provided a decryption of the transaction signature of the very first transfer sent to late Bitcoin pioneer Hal Finney. The decryption reads: “This Transaction was made by Paul Leroux to Hal Finney on January 12, 2009 #bitcoin.” However, two Bitcoin core devs, Peter Wuille and Greg Maxwell, expressed skepticism about Shkreli’s revelation.\nElon Musk shares mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto tweet\nSome news has to be taken with a pinch of humor (especially that concerning Elon Musk’s tweets), and the following piece of news is one of them. In a Twitter post from March 9, the Tesla CEO shared a meme related to the origin of Satoshi Nakamoto’s name. If we combine the names of the largest Asian companies and corporations (Samsung, Toshiba, Nakamichi and Motorola), the name “Satoshi Nakamoto” can be formed. Some users suggested that the meme is a hint that Satoshi's background is a Korean and American mix, while others assumed that the post is ironic and contains no hidden message.\nCharles Hoskinson responds to question about his “claiming to be Satoshi”"}, {"date": "2022-12-31 21:59:17", "entity": ["ftx", "manchester united", "nft", "deslucrec", "tezos", "manutd", "tezosf", "multicoin capital", "ftx", "multicoin", "ftx", "solana", "solana", "ftx", "multicoin capital", "solana", "solana", "solana", "dogecoin", "ftx", "avrah", "ftx", "alameda research", "btc", "alameda", "wasabi", "twitter", "mango markets", "t. co", "twitter"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt\nMarkets were mostly frozen this week, with most of the leading cryptocurrencies seeing very little price movement to end the year, except for the unlucky few—in particular Solana and Dogecoin, which suffered double-digit percentage drops.\nAD\nAD\nIt was another week of relatively few adoption moves or crypto dispatches from Washington.

For only one cryptocurrency and one crypto company, 2022 was not the beginning but the continuation of the fight for life. We are, of course, talking about XRP and Ripple and their opponent, the U.S. Securities Commission, with Gary Gensler at the helm.\nWarming\nAt the start of the year, the battle between the crypto business and the powerful regulator was more like an endless tug-of-war, and quite exhausting at that. However, that is probably to the credit of Ripple and the lawyers, who were willing to incur multi-million-dollar costs and not let go of their end of the \"rope,\" with only the \"fair notice\" argument up their sleeve.\nThe field around the case at the time was filled with predictions of an end date rather than concrete advances. Nevertheless, as early as February, it was disclosed through the court that Ripple had clarified XRP's \"not a security\" status with independent lawyers back in 2012, long before the SEC became aware of digital payments. From this point onward, Ripple began to score small victories here and there during the process, but it was not enough for Judge Torres to grant motions by the company’s executives, Brad Garlinghouse and Chris Larsen, to dismiss the case in March.\nHowever, at the same time, the court rejected the commission's attacks on Ripple's one and only \"fair notice\" argument, and the process started all over again. Ripple's next big victory came in April, when a court refused to allow the commission to withhold important confidential documents. It is worth noting that, all this time, a secondary \"storyline\" was running through the process, involving recordings of speeches by former SEC head William Hinman, which the commission was actively trying to keep out of the way.\nHeating\nSince then, Hinman's speeches have been a key focus of the battle between Ripple and the SEC. The case was finally moving into a hot and rather messy stage when, in July, the commission was rebuked for hypocrisy by Magistrate Judge Netburn for trying to conceal a number of facts, and its attorney-client privilege claims to keep Hinman's documents secret were rejected.\nAs time went on, Jed McCaleb emptied his \"taco stand\" of millions of XRP, and Brad Garlinghouse estimated legal fees at $100 million already, all the while sharing plans for an IPO and threatening to leave the U.S. if Ripple lost the case. The SEC then also failed in its attempt to fend off XRP holders, several tens of thousands of whom were joined by lawyer John Deaton in a class action lawsuit against the regulator.\nThe tug of justice continued to be pulled in different directions until mid-September, when important events began to unfold. The first of these was a report from the U.S. Chamber of Digital Commerce criticizing the SEC and expressing a desire to participate in the lawsuit as an independent third party by filing an amicus brief. The number of such filings would later grow to 16, with the majority filed in support of XRP and Ripple.\nAt the same time, the possibility of concluding the case through summary proceedings appeared, with the deadlines being outlined to the parties.\nFinally, in late September, Judge Torres decided to hand over internal documents, drafts and letters from William Hinman to Ripple, which became a big interim victory. Then, some time later, when they were finally delivered, Ripple's general counsel, Stuart Alderoty, said that the fight for the documents was definitely worth it, and that his attitude toward the SEC turned even more negative after receiving them.\nOver 18 months and 6 court orders later, we finally have the Hinman docs (internal SEC emails and drafts of his infamous 2018 speech). While they remain confidential for now (at the SEC’s insistence), I can say that it was well worth the fight to get them. — Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) October 20, 2022\nAt the same time, there was a growing number of those willing to provide amicus briefs in defense of XRP and Ripple, with the SEC in turn taking steps to prevent them from participating. Spoiler: they did not succeed.\nBoiling\nThe process continued on, but again in a closed-door manner, as the parties actively exchanged corrections to each other's submissions. Opinion in the crypto industry was thus increasingly tilting toward a Ripple victory, with the Blockchain Association and Coinbase filing their amicus briefs.\nHowever, a major new setback emerged for Ripple as crypto company LBRY lost its case against the SEC, where its LBC token was recognised as an unregistered security. It is becoming apparent that the regulator will take this precedent into account in its final response.\nThe fight continued in November, with public focus shifting to the collapse of major cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which was rendered insolvent by the criminally misguided actions of its executives. The parties continued to exchange documents, amendments and replies behind closed doors as part of reaching a summary judgment.\nAt this point, the parties' last action was to file motions for summary judgment with all the necessary oppositions and replies, filed under seal. So, the outgoing year of 2022 was not the final year for this crypto-regulatory epic, which will now apparently go for a third round. However, it can definitely be said that this year has accelerated things considerably and, just as importantly, exposed the problems that regulators have with cryptocurrencies at the moment."}, {"date": "2022-12-31 20:00:00", "entity": ["tweet xu", "arrows capital fund", "3ac", "ftx exchange", "sbf", "genesis", "ftx", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "ethereum", "defi", "3ac", "ftx", "eth", "defi", "okx", "twitter", "twitter", "ok group", "okx exchange", "twitter blue", "tesla", "spacex", "neuralink", "boring company", "twitter", "dogecoin", "boring company", "twitter", "dogecoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "doge", "twitter", "dogecoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto.\nIn the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.\nOver the last week, we spoke with institutions about their perception of 2022 and their outlook for the coming months. We’ll begin our experts round with Material Indicators, a market data, and analytics firm dedicated to building trading tools for the nascent sector.\nMaterial Indicators: “While we have yet to see tradfi (Traditional Finances) price in earnings contraction (~Q1’23) for the last leg down, we are already close to bottoming sentiment-wise.”\nMaterial Indicators and their team of analyst gauge market sentiment and liquidity and try to read between the lines of what big players are doing to provide a clear view, absent of noise, about its conditions and possible direction. This is what they told us:\nQ: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid?\nA: The difference is striking! Since the FTX blowup, the influx of new people to Crypto Twitter has been reduced to a trickle. Salty Youtubers will now advise you to sell your remaining coins to avoid a total loss. Telegram communities have been shrinking. Big accounts who’ve been telling their followers to buy have either quit or rebranded. While we have yet to see tradfi (Traditional Finances) price in earnings contraction (~Q1’23) for the last leg down, we are already close to bottoming sentiment-wise.\nQ: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision?\nA: It’s the other way around. Conditions create narratives. Loose monetary policy and abundant cheap credit create bubbles and nurture fraud. It’s only after the tide recedes that we see who has been swimming naked. With an imminent rise in unemployment, people will try to hide in bonds, which actually improves credit-availability for risk assets. So, while earnings-driven assets will feel pain on higher unemployment, credit-driven assets (risk assets) will feel relatively less pain.\nQ: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right?\nA: Terra/Luna was probably the catalyst for all the subsequent blowups and we have yet to see the full effects of contagion (DCG/Grayscale/Genesis are not fully resolved yet). As with any blowup, this will just invite more regulation that will neither protect investors, nor improve the potential for growth. We wanted institutional adoption and now we see that they had zero risk-management and gambled away their user funds.\nQ: Finally, across social media, you guys at Material Indicators made your bearish bias public. Are you more or less pessimistic than you were at the beginning of 2022? And what will you like to see to shift your bias and lean towards the long side of the market? We know a lot depends on the Federal Reserve, are the chances of a pivot and lower interest rates hikes higher?\nA: While we’re probably not quite out of the woods yet, we can already almost see the light. On poor earnings & poor forecasts bonds will likely catch a bid in Q1’23, and therefore make credit available to risk assets to dampen their fall or even help them recover (especially if the Treasury manages to relieve the RRP of its ~$2T idle liquidity). Bitcoin could also benefit from this as it’s only subject to credit-availability and not earnings. However, while inflation has been and will likely continue to fall for some time, it is unlikely that we’ve seen the last of it. So, keep an eye out for potentially re-surging inflation sometime in late-’23/early-’24."}, {"date": "2022-12-31 17:30:57", "entity": ["metaverse", "shiba", "shib", "metaverse", "meme coin also", "lazarus group", "ethereum", "merge", "cardano", "ethereum", "u. s. justice department", "bitfinex", ". morgan", "bitcoin", "ronin", "hackers ronin", "axie infinity", "usdc", "cardano", "bitcoin", "federal reserve", "celsius", "network", "celsius", "interpol", "enron", "mogul theranos", "ftx saga", "terraform labs", "ftx", "sbf", "ftx"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "As we wrap up yet another exciting year in cryptocurrency, it is time to look back at some of the defining moments of this turbulent market in 2022\nWith just hours until another year arrives and 2022 slips out of sight, there is no better opportunity than now to take a look back at all of the crypto’s noteworthy moments throughout this past year.\n10. “The Crocodile of Wall Street” gets arrested (February)\nIn February, the U.S. Justice Department unveiled its largest-ever seizure of financial assets after arresting two people who conspired to launder $5.1 billion in Bitcoin stolen during a 2016 hack of the Bitfinex currency exchange. Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather Morgan were apprehended by federal agents in New York City.

She referred to herself as \"the infamous crocodile of Wall Street.\"\n9. Joe Biden’s executive order brings more clarity (March)\nIn March, U.S. President Joe Biden published an executive order concerning government oversight of cryptocurrency. He mentioned that this move is meant to secure the nation’s financial system from threats like illicit financing and also increase fairness, efficiency and inclusiveness. The EO was generally praised within the cryptocurrency community as a welcome step forward.\n8. Shiba Inu enters metaverse (April)\nThe Shiba Inu team introduced a virtual world which it dubbed SHIB: The Metaverse in April. It promises to give land owners an opportunity to generate passive income and generate various rewards. Throughout the year, the meme coin also secured several metaverse-related partnerships.\n7. The EU comes close to banning Bitcoin (March)\nA proposed ban, if adopted, would effectively have prohibited the mining of new Bitcoins through the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus in the EU.\nHowever, after further deliberations, European regulators decided to scrap it as part of a revision of the MiCA legislation.\n6. Ronin Network gets drained by North Korean hackers (March)\nRonin Network, which is tied to popular blockchain gaming title Axie Infinity, had $615 million worth of Ether and USDC tokens stolen in March.\nLater, U.S. authorities determined that the infamous Lazarus Group, which is linked to the North Korean government, is responsible for the record-breaking heist.\n5. Ethereum’s Merge upgrade and Cardano’s Vasil hard fork go live (September)\nThe major upgrade, labeled the Merge, was finalized in September to much fanfare. The end result of this upgrade shifted the popular blockchain from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system, thus eliminating the energy-consuming mining process that was associated with Ethereum before.\nIn the same month, Cardano launched its Vasil upgrade after facing delays and technical obstacles. It came one year after the Alonzo hard fork.\n4. Bitcoin plunges to fresh two-year low (November)\nOn Nov. 21, Bitcoin extended its yearlong slide, plunging to a new yearly low of $15,479. The cryptocurrency was down more than 77% from its recent peak, with the Federal Reserve’s hawkish policy and a string of bankruptcies contributing to the sell-off.\n3. Celsius goes underwater (July)\nThe cryptocurrency lending sector was shaken to its core when Celsius Network declared bankruptcy, becoming the latest victim of a massive liquidity crisis. This came after Celsius unexpectedly suspended withdrawals for its customers, causing a market sell-off.\n2. Terra implodes, Do Kwon on the run (May)\nThe cryptocurrency market saw tremendous losses in value after Luna and sister stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed. TerraUSD lost its peg, undermining faith in the centralized stablecoin.\nAmid all this, there has been even more controversy as Interpol has posted a Red Notice for Do Kwon, the founder of Terraform Labs. Kwon’s location has since been unknown, but he is rumored to be hiding in Serbia.\n1. FTX files for bankruptcy, SBF ends up behind bars (November)\nCryptocurrency exchange FTX officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after losing nearly $32 billion in value in only days. U.S. authorities also charged Sam Bankman-Fried with defrauding investors. He was arrested in the Bahamas, extradited to the U.S and released on a $250 million bail. The stunning downfall of the wild-haired crypto mogul, which is comparable to that of Enron’s Jeffrey Skilling and Theranos’s Elizabeth Holmes, is undoubtedly the biggest crypto story of the year.

According to it, 2022 began with a drive toward the Vasil upgrade, named after Vasil St. Dabov, one of Cardano's ambassadors.\nOn Sept. 22, the Vasil hard fork upgrade was triggered on the Cardano mainnet, while Vasil capabilities were deployed five days later on Sept. 27. Vasil brought an increase to Cardano's performance and scalability, enhancing the network's capabilities.\nAlso in the year, the Cardano community and business builders came together from around the globe to gather at a host of events. Two community-organized events, the cNFT conference and the Rare Bloom event held in the fall of 2022, had several people in attendance. At the Rare Bloom event, IOG's light wallet platform designed to unlock Web3 was introduced.\nIn August, Input Output Global (IOG) announced its partnership with the prestigious Stanford University to fund blockchain research. In a celebrated feat, the Cardano builder unveiled its funding of a new $4.5 million \"Blockchain Research Hub\" at Stanford University.\nIOG said it closed out the year with the IO ScotFest event in Edinburgh, where the Edinburgh Decentralization Index was launched as part of a drive to add greater transparency and inclusive accountability to the decentralized technology space. Also, Midnight, a new data protection-focused Cardano sidechain, was introduced during the event.\nIOG took a moment to offer wishes for the New Year and added that in 2023, an enhanced governance system within a new member-based organization will provide enhanced frameworks for the continuing development of Cardano."}, {"date": "2022-12-31 13:30:00", "entity": ["solana", "twitter", "solana", "solana ftx", "alameda", "solana", "solana", "solana", "solana", "cosmos", "magik labs", "solana", "hardcore", "devotees", "nerds", "ethereum", "cosmos", "solana", "solana", "ethereum", "cosmos", "solana", "solana", "solana", "ethereum", "solana", "solana", "ethereum", "cosmos"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Chris Burniske of VC firm Placeholder, the author of many early models of digital asset valuation, explained why Solana (SOL) looks special to him despite having a terrific year.\nIndependent innovation, committed community, easy-to-use product: Chris Burniske is bullish on Solana\nBurniske took to Twitter to share his vision of the Solana (SOL) blockchain, its endeavors and prospects in 2022.

Bitcoin’s hash rate—a mark of the computing power of the network—dropped nearly 40% and bottomed out at 156.36 EH/s. It has since recovered to 247.87 EH/s.\nIt was a very different story for Solana. SOL faced the heaviest losses this week of the top twenty coins by market cap, depreciating 17% to trade at $9.78 at the start of the weekend.

He thinks that regulation will need time to be responsibly developed and implemented.\nHe sees a sea change in crypto and states:\n“In crypto, years of greed will make room for real-world applications. The years of creating a token out of thin air and making millions are over. The music has stopped. We’re back to our regular programming of having to create real value and solving real world problems.”\nIn the solving of these problems he expects to see:\n“key innovations in the areas of payments, asset securitization, DeFi, zero-knowledge applications including proof of reserves and layer 1 scaling solutions, and a renewed development energy and interest on the Bitcoin network.”\nSceptical on regulation\nOnce more on regulation, Marcus is not very hopeful that the regulators will get it right. He believes that new regulation is necessary for digital assets and crypto, contrary to the belief of Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, who believes that crypto must be shoehorned into existing regulation. He says:\n“Sadly, I’ve become increasingly skeptical of our ability to reach consensus on legislative or regulatory approaches that achieve the right balance in these areas. I think we will therefore see more of the same in 2023 with increased responsibility on leaders of industries to do what they believe is right in the vacuum left by our deadlocked legislative system.”\nHowever, he is of the firm belief that “destruction comes with an opportunity to rebuild anew”, and that despite an extremely challenging environment, digital assets and crypto will come out of this next period stronger and better.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The Nashville-based asset manager, which manages around $180 million in assets, announced the launch of the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, which is looking to take advantage of the significant discount in the value of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.\nThe plan is considered extremely ambitious, considering the fact that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust manages over $10 billion in assets, compared to Valkyrie’s $180 million. The Valkyrie fund plans to increase its holdings of GBTC, enabling the company to realize the true value of the underlying Bitcoin for its investors. In a letter posted on its website, co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments, Steven McClurg, stated,\n“We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done. However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.”\nA Long Shot?\nIn the proposal, Valkyrie highlighted several ways through which they aim to improve the current management of GBTC. The fund stated that it aims to facilitate redemptions at a net asset value (NAV) for investors through a Regulation M filing, allowing investors to redeem their shares at a fair price. The proposal also seeks to lower the fee to 75 basis points, compared to the current 200 basis points, and offer redemptions in BTC and cash.\nHowever, a move to manage and sponsor the trust could be a long shot, considering Grayscale filings have stated that shareholders can play no part in the management or control of the trust. Additionally, they also have limited voting rights. It also states that no amendments to the trust agreement that could impact the interest of shareholders can be made without a vote of at least a majority (50%) of the shares.\nValkyrie also noted that it has a proven track record of success, running its own Bitcoin Trust since January 2021. It added that it has launched a host of Bitcoin-related ETFs and was, along with VanEck and ProShares, one of the firms to launch the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021.\nTrading Below Value\nCurrently, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is trading around 50% below the value of the Bitcoin it holds. This is because of the structure of the GBTC, where while new shares can be created, they cannot be destroyed as demand for the trust’s underlying Bitcoin faces a bit of a downturn, leading to a discount in the net asset value. On its part, Grayscale tried to convert the GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) which would allow for share redemptions.\nHowever, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied the application to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale was highly critical of the move by the SEC, calling it arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory, and filed a lawsuit against the agency.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

After his family put up the required collateral against his $250 million \"appearance bond\" (the largest ever) he was released to fly to Palo Alto to stay with his parents.\nBankman-Fried is expected to plead not guilty to the charges next week in New York, according to a Wall Street Journal report.\nMore than $1.7 million worth of cryptocurrency held in wallets tied to Alameda Research was swapped through exchanges and coin mixers and moved this week. Coin mixers are used to obscure the movement of crypto funds between wallets, meaning it’s unlikely that the funds are being moved by liquidators as part of bankruptcy proceedings around FTX and Alameda.\nThe funds are still on the move as of Friday, as pseudonymous on-chain sleuth ZachXBT noted that Bitcoin has been moved into Wasabi, the Bitcoin-centric wallet that can group transactions together in an effort to hide their origins.\nIt’s currently unclear who, then, is transferring the funds from these wallets, although many crypto observers pointed to Bankman-Fried since he is now free at home and, clearly, able to use the internet. Although he denied it, many prominent crypto builders, investors, and personalities quickly replied to his tweet to call him a liar and a fraud.\nFTX and Alameda Research filed for bankruptcy in November following a liquidity crunch, with billions of dollars’ worth of customer funds reportedly missing from the companies. Alameda allegedly tapped into FTX customer funds to plug its own holes from trading losses incurred this summer as the crypto market crashed.\nBankman-Fried followed up his initial denial tweet with a theory of his own: \"It is likely the case that various legit legs of FTX have the ability to access these funds; hopefully that's what's happening here,\" he said. \"I would be happy to help advise regulators on this if any wanted.\""}, {"date": "2022-12-30 23:00:36", "entity": ["xrp", "aps software", "nft", "nft", "nft", "nft", "nfts", "tradingview. com", "nft", "nft"], "sentiment": ["Positive", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The NFT market took a rather significant beating in the year 2022 despite reaching its peak trading volume at the start of the year.

In fact, the graph shows more of a zig-zag pattern meaning that the volume has seen highs and lows during this time.\nDaily trading volume at the start of December was at $33 million and by December 29, this figure stood at $47 million. So this represents around a 42% increase in trading volume in 30 days. However, zooming out and looking at the 7-day chart shows a more bullish movement.\nStanding at $20 million on December 25, there has been a more than 100% increase in the daily volume over the last week. This explains the renewed vigor in the NFT market this week, but it does not necessarily mean that the NFT bull market is back in full swing.\nVolume grows 42% in December | Source: IntoTheBlock\nThe fact remains that the number of NFT sales has nosedived in the last few days, with 63,000 new sales on Thursday compared to Wednesday’s 123,000. So while volume in dollar figures may be up, investors are still buying fewer NFTs and the number of collections being is also down.\nNFT Popularity Still Dropping\nLike with any new space, the popularity of NFTs was largely driven by the adoption of new users. This was what drove it to its peak in January 2022, but it has not been able to maintain this momentum. According to IntoTheBlock, the number of new addresses buying NFTs is on the decline.\nMarket declines over 60% in 2022 | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com\nOn Thursday, December 29, only 5,780 new addresses were using NFTs, reaching a near two-year low. The last time it was this low was in February 2021 when non-fungible tokens were still trying to establish themselves in the crypto market.\nCollections being created have also touched a one-year low. Only 675 new collections were created on Thursday, bringing it down to November 2021 levels. Other important metrics include the number of unique collections being bought which was 111 for the same time period.\nOn a more encouraging note, the XRP NFT market has been seeing an uptick in adoption.

The platform uses Bitcoin’s technology to power more than just digital money, enabling verifiable ownership of digital assets like artwork and collectibles.\nAD\nAD\nHere’s a look at how Counterparty works and how it differs from more recent NFT-centric platforms, plus a look at how these assets are being bridged to a larger audience via Ethereum.\nWhat is Counterparty?\nIn traditional finance lexicon, a counterparty is the other person or party participating in a transaction. But in the Web3 world, Counterparty refers to a “metacoin-type protocol” founded in 2014 by Robert Dermody, Adam Krellenstein, and Evan Wagner.\nWith a native decentralized exchange (DEX) and token, Counterparty was built atop the open and decentralized Bitcoin network to let users mint, buy, and sell unique digital assets.\nWhile this may be common today on platforms like Ethereum and Solana, at the time, Counterparty's launch marked a significant turning point in digital history. It helped people realize that Bitcoin's design can apply to any asset or transaction that requires a degree of verification—not just an alternative form of money, or a store of value.\nCounterparty also set the stage for the global crypto art and collectibles movement, as seen with native projects like Spells of Genesis in 2015 and Rare Pepes in 2016—both considered seminal precursors to the modern NFT boom.\nHow does Counterparty work?\nSimilar to how Ethereum token standards define how certain assets work on its protocol, Counterparty provides the infrastructure that outlines how people can create unique tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. These assets aren’t limited to digital collectibles or tokens, but anything with proven rarity—even physical items.\nCounterparty is akin to a layer-2 solution for Bitcoin: a platform built on top of Bitcoin that inherits the security of the original blockchain, but provides additional functionality. In that sense, it’s similar to Stacks, another platform that’s built on top of Bitcoin to provide smart contract functionality to power NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.\nAs Counterparty is Bitcoin-native and can embed and use data from the Bitcoin protocol when executing contracts, transacting on the platform looks just as it would when using BTC. Counterparty nodes simply interpret the data in these transactions based on specific rules. From there, the protocol creates its own ledger of related transactions that it has seen on the underlying Bitcoin network.\nAD\nAD\nAnother way to think about how transactions on Counterparty work is via the concept of nesting or Russian dolls, whereby the Bitcoin transaction would contain a smaller Counterparty transaction inside of it. Added complexities aside, the transactions on Counterparty are the same as Bitcoin, and therefore just as secure.\nThat said, a notable difference between Bitcoin and Counterparty is in the relationship between nodes. Unlike Bitcoin nodes, Counterparty nodes don't communicate with each other and don't offer a \"peer-to-peer network.\" While they all share the same code and receive the same transaction data, the primary role of Counterparty nodes is to connect to the Bitcoin software.\nOnce connected, the nodes then download and decode data from each transaction all while benefiting from Bitcoin's security and computing power. In addition, as with gas on Ethereum, users still need to pay mining fees when transacting on Counterparty.\nWhat else does Counterparty do?\nAlong with powering verifiably unique assets, Counterparty also supports a range of added functions. Some of these include:\nMultisignature addresses: “Multisig” refers to situations in which two or more individuals (via their private keys) must approve and sign off on transactions before they can execute. By providing multisig support, Counterparty offers more robust security and a comprehensive range of utility for its users, like helping remote teams work together. It also provides token issuers a safe way to store their assets, plus better control over distribution.\nGovernance and voting: Users can also create and tap Counterparty tokens to vote for a desired outcome in a DAO or online community (e.g. DevParty ). That said, stake voting with the native Counterparty currency, XCP, is still under development. It’s planned to allow for robust, decentralized governance of the Counterparty protocol.\nCounterparty DEX: Prior to Uniswap and SushiSwap , Counterparty launched one of the first successful decentralized exchanges, which functions as a native feature built into the protocol itself. As with any DEX, the protocol takes on the role of an escrow agent and clearing house, removing unnecessary costs, time, and third-party risks for users when making transactions. People can view open orders on the DEX through xchain.io (a related block explorer), and interact with it through supported wallets like Freewallet or Rare Pepe Wallet by placing buy and sell orders on assets they’d like to exchange.\nHow do dispensers work?\nA common way to buy and sell assets on Counterparty is through automated dispensers. Similar to vending machines, anyone can set up a dispenser and specify an amount of the token or asset they want to sell through it, along with the price in BTC or Counterparty's own XCP token.\nBuying assets from dispensers is not all that different from transferring or sending tokens between wallets. All a buyer needs to do is scan the dispenser QR barcode or manually copy the dispenser wallet address, and then send the amount of BTC or XCP they want to spend to buy one or more of the items on offer. Upon receipt, the dispenser will then distribute the asset to the buyer's wallet.\nAnother way to think about dispensers is as a basic smart contract with predefined rules that autonomously distribute and manage its assets. To help mitigate any risk or scams, an empty dispenser will display a warning sign alongside it, telling buyers not to send any BTC as the dispenser is closed.\nWhat is XCP?\nBuying assets on Counterparty and its dispensers can be done through the protocol’s native XCP token. Instead of the more traditional fundraising techniques for altcoin launches, like crowd sales or initial coin offerings (ICOs), Counterparty used the proof-of-burn (PoB) consensus protocol to issue XCP in January 2014.\nTo create a larger commitment to secure the network, a miner will burn a portion of coins in their possession to buy a virtual mining rig, which gives them the right and power to mine blocks on the Counterparty network. The more coins the miner burns, the larger his or her virtual mining \"platform\" will be.\nThe Counterparty team said that it settled on Proof of Burn to keep the distribution of tokens as fair and decentralized as possible, and avoid potential legal issues. To create XCP in the network, approximately 2,140 BTC—worth upwards of $2 million at the time—was destroyed or \"burned\" by sending them to a provably unspendable Bitcoin address with no known private key. In other words, they're lost forever.\nAD\nAD\nThe XCP token is also used in various ways in the Counterparty protocol, like helping users create new assets, trade, and make bets. XCP trades on exchanges like Dex-Trade and Zaif, paired with either BTC or the Japanese yen.\nRare Pepe NFT cards on Counterparty. Image: Rare Pepes\nWhat are Counterparty’s biggest projects?\nSince its release, many notable projects have been launched and supported on Counterparty. Some of these include:\nSpells of Genesis : In March 2015, EverdreamSoft released the first-ever blockchain trading card, FDCARD , on the Counterparty platform, which was later used in its strategic blockchain card game, Spells of Genesis. In the game, players can collect, trade, and combine assets called ORBs to build the strongest decks on the Bitcoin blockchain, test them against opponents, and explore the fantasy realm of Askian.\nRare Pepes: In response to the demand for on-chain collectible assets, the first Rare Pepes —meme images based on Matt Furie’s original Pepe the Frog character—were minted in September 2016 and could be bought and sold through Bitcoin or XCP. A thriving ecosystem still exists on Counterparty, where collectors can buy original cards and the later fake rare, dank rare, and fake common cards.\nBassmint : Created by a group of long-standing artists, musicians, and technologists in the Bitcoin community, Bassmint is a new cryptographic music directory and label on Counterparty designed to give more revenue and power back to creators. Through Counterparty, artists can mint their music and have it curated on Bassmint, and get paid in Bitcoin directly by fans.\nHODLpet : Known as the first \"living creature\" hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain, HODLpet is akin to an online Tamagotchi, collectively nurtured by a community of HODLers , or as a community-led choose-your-own-adventure story. Added features include NFT artwork drops by notable artists, plus a playable NFT card game.\nPhockheads: As one of the first-ever digital collectibles, Phockheads have been rescued from their inactive and somewhat forgotten home on Namecoin—an early blockchain platform forked from Bitcoin—to live again through Counterparty.\nHow is it connected to Ethereum?\nHowever, these projects don't just live in isolation on Counterparty, thanks to the Ethereum Emblem Vault. Launched in September 2020, the Emblem Vault is a tokenized multi-asset wallet designed to support NFTs and fungible tokens alike on various blockchains.\nCollectors can wrap their Bitcoin-based assets like Rare Pepes and Spells of Genesis Cards to bring them onto the Ethereum blockchain—as a native ERC-721 token—through the vault. That allows these projects to be traded via the leading NFT platform and through major marketplaces like OpenSea.\nDoing so not only helps bring exposure to Counterparty projects, but also simplifies the trading experience for users that find Counterparty confusing or intimidating.\nWhich wallets are on Counterparty?\nCounterparty offers a native wallet called Counterwallet. However, storing assets like Rare Pepes or XCP tokens can be done with a range of alternatives including:\nFreeWallet : a free, open-source wallet that supports Bitcoin and Counterparty. Through FreeWallet, users can send and receive BTC and tokens, create and issue tokens, sign and broadcast messages, and support multiple addresses. The app is available for both iOS and Android devices, and runs in web browsers as well.\nRare Pepe Wallet : Created by noted developer Joe Looney , Rare Pepe Wallet is one of the best-known and most widely used Counterparty wallets for traders to collect and store Rare Pepe cards. People can also buy and search Rare Pepes through the wallet using BTC, PepeCash, or XCP.\nFreeport : As a Google Chrome extension, Freeport supports Bitcoin and Counterparty tokens. It also allows users to collect, trade, and create unique assets on Bitcoin.\nThe future of Counterparty\nThe NFT market exploded in popularity and awareness over the last couple years, driven by thriving platforms like Ethereum, Solana, and Flow. Counterparty doesn't have anywhere near the same level of hype or demand today, but its role in helping to pioneer the concept of unique, tokenized assets remains clear.\nEven so, Counterparty has a dedicated community that has continued to work on the platform since its release. The developer scene welcomes builders and provides security-related bounties, and new contributors can run a node if they please.\nAs Counterparty is built on the back of Bitcoin’s security—which itself is enforced through the resource-intensive proof-of-work mining model—its native assets aren't at significant risk of being lost, nor do they rely on external storage servers like IPFS. The global network of miners and node operators helps secure the platform.\nJust as Bitcoin serves as a cornerstone to the entire crypto economy, Counterparty has sustained its relevance through the collective array of memes, projects, and initiatives that have endured on the long-running protocol. It’s an important piece of the history of NFTs, now more accessible than ever thanks to the Ethereum Emblem Vault.\nAD\nAD"}, {"date": "2022-12-30 19:47:23", "entity": ["bitcoin", "bitcoin", "centre for alternative university of cambridge"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The past year started with a noticeable centralization of the bitcoin mining hashrate in the U.S. In January, the U.S. accounted for about 38% of computing power on the Bitcoin blockchain, and Canada almost 7%, according to the Centre for Alternative Finance at the University of Cambridge.

Here is a chart that shows how some of the biggest narratives of 2021 performed this year:\nThe year-to-date drawdowns of some of the digital asset sectors | Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review\nAs the above graph displays, privacy coins performed the best out of all these market segments this year, but the sector still amassed significant losses of around 47%. The report notes that the privacy coins outperforming the others is likely because of Monero’s sustained utility in darknet transactions. Year-to-date, XMR itself is down 35%.\nThe biggest loser this year was Metaverse, with the sector seeing a massive drawdown of 89% since the start of the year. It would appear that all the hype surrounding the mythical digital parallel world couldn’t survive in this harsh bear market, despite all the momentum it seemingly built up last year.\nMeta, one of the biggest proponents of Metaverse, has also performed badly since the company switched its name from Facebook and pivoted towards this next level of the internet. The company also participated in mass layoffs earlier this year.\nAlternative layer 1s, another hot topic of 2021, find themselves as the second worst performers in the market, being up there with Metaverse in terms of returns (-85%) when excluding Binance’s BNB. Layer 1s are blockchains that are independent of any other (that is, not built on any other chain), and can host their smart contract ecosystem. “Alternative” here naturally refers to the layer 1s outside of Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nBTC and ETH themselves had historically poor years, observing sharp drawdowns of 65% and 68%, respectively. Interestingly, the exchange tokens have outperformed them both, as their negative returns stand at 57% when excluding FTX’s FTT token, and 58% when including it.\nHowever, it would seem that BNB is doing most of the legwork in getting the exchange tokens to outperform Bitcoin and Ethereum, as without it these tokens are 73% underwater. For 2023, Arcane Research predicts that these exchange tokens will “face serious regulatory scrutiny due to the FTX collapse, and certain tokens will be labeled as securities.”\nBTC Price\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $16,500, down 2% in the last week.\nLooks like the value of the crypto has declined during the last few days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Art Rachen on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Arcane Research"}, {"date": "2022-12-30 18:00:14", "entity": ["bitcoin", "bsp", "ftx", "coins. ph", "ftx", "ftx", "coins. ph", "philippines central bank", "amazon", "facebook", "google", "celsius", "3ac", "blockfi", "ftx", "ftx", "ftx", "blofin", "binance", "binance", "bitcoinist", "ftx", "bitcoin", "ethereum"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "2022 is coming to an end, and our staff at Bitcoinist decided to launch this Crypto Holiday Special to provide some perspective on the crypto industry. We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto.\nZhou: “It won’t be business as usual for centralized exchanges. For one, the days of commingling users and the exchanges’ assets are long gone.”\nIn the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.\nWe are ending our institutional round with Wei Zhou; for three years, he worked as Chief Financial Officer at the largest crypto exchange worldwide, Binance. Above the rest, this company and its current CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, heavily impacted the nascent industry and will continue to exercise influence in the coming years.\nZhou: “Bitcoin, just like the Internet, will survive any storm that comes its way; this I have no inkling of doubt about.”\nZhou reviews the biggest moment in 2022 from his unique perspective. In addition, he talks about the fundamentals that will keep crypto alive and on track to fulfill its destiny. This is what he told us:\nQ: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid?\nA: The crypto market has certainly changed a lot in the past year.\nCollapse of key industry players\nI think the biggest change this year has been due to the collapse of some key industry players, from Celsius, 3AC to BlockFi and most recently FTX. With billions of dollars affected, investors have become cautious. The collapse of these giants has served to remind us to be prudent and diligent with our crypto investment decisions. Users should conduct thorough research and abstain from entities whose licensing and regulatory status is unclear. I believe that the situation will change in 2023 and that investor confidence will resume, but we can’t afford to forget the lessons learned this year.\nLiquidity affected but adoption will continue to grow\nWith the collapse of a big market maker like FTX, liquidity in the market was affected as several exchanges relied on it. Investors have also pulled quite a bit of their money from exchanges which further escalated the liquidity crunch. Speculative trading may have pulled back, but for those to whom crypto was more focused on use cases like value transfer, web3 gaming and financial inclusion, crypto adoption will continue to surge especially in the Philippines.\nQ: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision?\nThis year’s market downturn has fueled crypto skeptics and several mainstream media houses who have become re-energized in their fight against crypto. This narrative has put doubts in the minds of investors. However, most people are overlooking that Bitcoin is designed to be a decentralized electronic currency.\nCrypto is still the future of finance. If you recall, when the dot-com bubble burst, there were all manner of questions about the viability of the Internet as a technology and the companies building on it. But look at Amazon, Facebook, Google and others today – they are defining the world we live in. This is because, despite the shake-ups with the market players, the underlying technology was fundamentally transformative. Bitcoin, just like the Internet, will survive this winter.\nQ: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right?\nA: I would point to the FTX collapse as a landmark moment. Its impact has been and will continue to be felt in the industry.\nInvestors are keener about who they trust with their assets and how custodians and exchanges store the assets. Investors are now exploring self-custody solutions, which contrary to opinion I think is a great direction to take. When they require to trade their assets, they are now keen to work with exchanges that are fully regulated like Coins.ph which is licensed by the Philippines central bank and is regularly audited.\nRegulators are more concerned about the industry. We will also see a trend where regulators around the world will begin to create a more comprehensive regulatory framework around cryptocurrency.\nThe crypto industry has gone through worse. In 2017, the crypto markets peaked and crashed to $3,000, and the industry endured a three-year-long crypto winter. In 2022, we now have institutional investors who are advancing the sector, unlike during prior winters.\nI believe the industry will survive because there are now much more use cases than there were in the past.\nQ: What’s next for exchanges such as Binance in 2023 and beyond? Do you think the recent events with FTX will jeopardize the future of these platforms? Many are already speculating about the shift in liquidity from Centralize to Decentralize Exchanges (DEX) due to the users’ lack of confidence in the former\nA: The days of commingling users and the exchanges’ assets are long gone. FTX has woken up the entire industry to the dangers this practice can have. Proof of reserves is already becoming a big trend as more investors ask questions about how and where their assets are stored.\nRelated Reading: A Crypto Holiday Special: Past, Present, And Future With Blofin\nRegulators are also cracking down much harder on exchanges. In the Philippines, for instance, the BSP was quick to audit exchanges in order to probe if they had been exposed to the FTX contagion. Thankfully, neither Coins.ph nor our peers were exposed to FTX.\nThe crypto industry will be shifting to focus on Web3, decentralized exchanges and self-custody. More users are now exploring wallets that give them full ownership of their crypto. I am a big supporter of self-custody for those with the technical ability to do it successfully. When they require trade, I would advise them to always use an exchange that’s licensed and supervised by a recognized national or regional watchdog."}, {"date": "2022-12-30 17:51:29", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "The domino effect, seen when the failure of one crypto institution quickly spreads to another, is hardly without precedent.

With the numerous collapses and bankruptcies that were witnessed this year alone, it comes as no surprise that the market is marking the end on a low note. However, as another year is ushered in, there are numerous cryptocurrencies in the space that offer opportunities in the coming year. Here is a list of assets that have proven and will continue to prove themselves.\nBitcoin (BTC)\nNaturally, bitcoin tops the list of top cryptos to look out for in the new year. Being the pioneer of the space, the digital asset still commands a large share of the market, as well as multiple bull runs with performances that have outpaced anyone’s expectations.\nWhen looking at digital assets to invest in for the new year, look no further than BTC. It is the closest to a ‘sure’ investment that crypto users can get. Additionally, it makes for a good hedge against inflation due to continued outperformance. If the asset marks its bottom in the new year, then there could be a good rally in price.\nEthereum (ETH)\nAfter bitcoin, the next best thing in the crypto market remains ethereum. There have even been arguments that this asset is better than its predecessor bitcoin because of its wide array of use cases, including but not limited to the popular decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible token (NFT) sectors.\nJust as well as this asset has done in use cases, it has been good investment-wise. It hit a high of $4,800 before the bear market began, and while it is down over 70% from this all-time high value, ETH still packs a punch and is one of the digital assets expected to perform incredibly well in the next bull market.\nDogecoin (DOGE)\nAt first glance, the appearance of dogecoin on this list may seem out of place but it has earned its spot. The meme coin has since moved from being a joke among social media users to being one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world. It continues to enjoy the support of the likes of Elon Musk and Matt Wallace who have shown no signs of slowing down.\nDOGE’s social media following also ballooned to over 3 million followers on Twitter, with over 4.5 million holders. This means that there is still a lot of faith in the digital asset despite current low prices. And as the bull run of 2021 showed, it is not necessarily the utility that determines if a cryptocurrency will do well, but rather the amount of support it receives from investors. This makes dogecoin a reasonable bet going forward.\nBinance Coin (BNB)\nBinance Coin (BNB) is arguably one of the best performers of the bull market. Even in the bear market, the coin has held on to gains better than its larger counterparts such as bitcoin and ethereum. BNB is backed by Binance, which is the largest crypto exchange in the world by trading volume. Being tied to such a formidable business has done wonders for the asset, which is currently the 5th largest cryptocurrency in the world by market cap.\nBNB carries great promise in 2023 as Binance overcomes the FUD targeted at it. The crypto exchange has also shown users that it is able to withstand the sort of bank run that led to the bankruptcy of FTX, which shows that they remain in a strong position. As Binance continues to dominate, so will its native coin, BNB.\nXRP (XRP)\nXRP is one digital asset whose growth had been stunted by the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ongoing case against Ripple. However, with the case has been in court for so long, it is likely that an end is close. If Ripple were to triumph over the SEC in this case, then the price of XRP will likely explode in response.\nOne problem with this pick is that unlike the others in this list, it stands to lose a lot if the case goes in favor of the SEC. So an investment in XRP is more than not a gamble on how the Ripple v. SEC case will turn out. There is potential for a lot of profit but also, the potential for a lot of losses with this one.\nBonus (Shiba Inu)\nShiba Inu receives an honorary mention on this list due to its performance in 2021. The meme coin has suffered multiple dips and crashes that have left the large majority of holders in loss, but its large and strong community shows there may still be more left in store with this digital asset.\nMarket cap drops to $751 billion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com\nFeatured image from TechStory, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-30 16:00:29", "entity": ["bit arcane research", "bitcoin", "arcane research", "bitcoin", "core scientific core scientific", "core", "btc", "bitcoin", "btc", "coinbase", "meme coin", "arcane research", "btc", "bitcoin", "btc", "btcus", "becca", "unsplash tradingview. com", "arcane research"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Data shows almost all the big public crypto companies have underperformed Bitcoin this year, with the mining firms taking an especially hard hit.\nMost Public Mining Companies Saw Drawdowns Of 90% Or More In 2022\nAs per the year-end report from Arcane Research, 2022 was a very challenging year for public firms in the crypto sector. The below chart displays the drawdowns in the valuations of some of the big players in the market, as well as that of Bitcoin, during the last twelve months:\nThe deep red performance of the public companies in the digital asset sector | Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review\nAs the graph shows, Bitcoin performed terribly this year, seeing negative returns of around 65%, but the large public crypto firms have done worse still. Even Microstrategy, the company whose stocks’ main attraction is exposure to BTC through its large reserves, couldn’t perform comparably to the asset and observed a deeper year-to-date drawdown of about 74%.\nThe market cap of the popular crypto exchange Coinbase has gone down by 87% this year, which has led to the firm being valued lower than meme coin Dogecoin. The worst performer in the list seems to have been Core Scientific, recording a drawdown of 99%. Core Scientific is one of the biggest Bitcoin mining companies, but due to these large losses, the firm had to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier in the month.\nSimilarly to Core, other BTC miners have also sustained major drawdowns this year, with most of them being 90% or more underwater for the period. But why did the mining firms perform especially poorly? The explanation behind that is multifold.\n“Similar to how crypto lenders were incentivized to prioritize short-term growth over long-term sound business decisions to attract private capital, public miners were incentivized to take on debt and rapidly expand its hashrate share to attract more capital,” the report explains.\nBut three factors meant that this bet from these companies couldn’t pan out. First, the interest rates kept rising this year. Second, the bear market meant that the price of Bitcoin kept plunging, leading to the value of miners’ rewards also becoming lower.\nAnd finally, the third nail in the coffin was the rising energy prices, which resulted in very low or no profits for miners as they have to constantly pay electricity bills to keep their facilities running. All these factors lead to the public miners collapsing under the weight of their short-sighted decisions.\nFor 2023, Arcane Research’s prediction for these public crypto companies is that there will be new Chapter 11 bankruptcies filed in the year.\nBTC Price\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $16,500, down 2% in the last week.\nLooks like BTC has gone downhill in recent days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Becca on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Arcane Research"}, {"date": "2022-12-30 16:00:00", "entity": ["orbn", "orbn", "orbn", "orbn", "orbeon", "aptos", "aptos", "aptos", "aptos", "aptos", "aptos", "apt", "aptos", "polygon", "polygon", "reddit", "donald trump", "nft", "polygon", "polygon", "polygon", "polygon", "polygon", "aptos", "aptos", "aptos", "aptos", "orbeon protocol", "polygon", "aptos"], "sentiment": ["Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "The crypto market is always active.

It’s interesting to note that Polygon (MATIC) hasn’t gotten anywhere close to $2 after January 2022. Despite the sudden interest and whale activity, Polygon (MATIC) cannot be a worthy choice for crypto investment.\nIs Aptos (APT) Going to Lose the Price Marathon\nAptos (APT) is one of the latest blockchain platforms in the crypto market. Aptos (APT) touched its highest point on 23rd October 2022. The price of Aptos (APT) token hovered around the all time high for a brief period and then fell below the $8.5 mark on 28th October. Unfortunately, Aptos (APT) hasn’t succeeded in attracting crypto lovers in large numbers.\nThe Aptos (APT) price graph had more lows than highs during the last two months. The Aptos (APT) token price fell to its lowest point at $3.67 on 10th November 2022. Aptos (APT) is at $3.76, at the time of writing. The Aptos (APT) platform is planning the Aptos World Tour Hackathon in 2023 and will travel to four cities in different countries. This might bring some traction for Aptos (APT), but experts say it may not be enough to create a long-term impact.\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is the New Token Taking the Crypto Market by Storm\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a venture capital platform aiming to revolutionize crowdfunding through its unique NFTs as a service. Startups seeking to raise capital on the platform can mint equity-backed, fractionalized NFTs available for as little as $1. This allows startups to raise capital more efficiently, while everyday investors can buy into startups with comparatively low capital.\nORBN, the project’s native token, has seen significant growth and attention during presale. ORBN grants holders various benefits like staking rewards, access to exclusive investor groups, and more.\nORBN has already risen from $0.004 to $0.0362 in presale, however analysts expect this to continue until ORBN has risen by a factor of 6000% in January.\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\nTelegram: https://t.me/OrbeonProtocol\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

However, the fact remains that these two payment services are not functional in all countries around the globe. It remains to be seen how Binance plans to increase accessibility in these zones.\nOther Crypto Firms Adopting Apple Pay\nBinance is not the first crypto firm to adopt more mainstream payment services. Apple Pay itself has been adopted by other crypto platforms, like MetaMask. This crypto wallet, which is the preferred mode of interaction with the Ethereum blockchain (DeFi, Web3 dApps, NFTs), integrated Apple Pay into its platform in March 2022. Another crypto wallet, Klever, also added Apple Pay functionality back in April 2021 to provide users with an easier payment option.\nBinance In The News\nThe crypto exchange has been in the news lately since word spread that Binance.US was planning on buying Voyager Digital assets. The crypto exchange put forth a bid of $1 billion and was successful in acquiring the Voyager assets just a few weeks ago.\nBinance had also paused USDC stablecoin withdrawals for several hours, leading to some market-wide FUD around mid-December. The reason given for the pause was insufficient USDC reserves, which warranted a BUSD to USDC swap, after which the service was resumed as normal.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Like other entities on the blockchain, DeFi is public and doesn’t involve any centralized party to get things done (as transactions are peer-to-peer).\nThe “total value locked” (TVL) is a metric that measures the total amount of capital that has currently been deposited by users in DeFi protocols. The below chart shows how the TVL of DeFi built on the Ethereum blockchain has changed over the course of the year 2022:\nLooks like the value of the metric has seen a significant drawdown | Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review\nAs the above graph displays, the Ethereum DeFi TVL was more than $95 billion at the start of this year. However, capital has exited the sector as the bear market has grown deeper, much like in the rest of the crypto market. Now, the metric has a value of just $23 billion, meaning that ETH DeFi has seen a drawdown of around 76% over the year, according to the year-end report from Arcane Research.\nThe dominance of Ethereum DeFi (the percentage share of the total DeFi TVL across all blockchains) itself has, however, actually observed a rise of more than 2% this year. From the chart, it’s apparent that this increase coincided with the Terra LUNA collapse, suggesting that the dominance gain was because of capital exiting the Terra DeFi apps.\nThe report notes that while the year has been bad for DeFi, the sector has “withstood chaotic and turbulent times in crypto credit markets and offered well-needed transparency and reliability in contrast to the centralized crypto lenders in the last year.”\nHowever, it’s also true that DeFi has faced chaos of its own this year as well. In 2022, there were many DeFi and bridge-related hacks amounting to a total of $3 billion, as the below chart shows.\nRonin's hack seems to have been the largest this year | Source: Arcane Research's 2022 - Year in Review\nThe report believes that proper revenue sharing among DeFi token holders would gain momentum next year, as currently, no token provides any meaningful value to the investors (besides acting as a governance token), and so revenue rights for holders could be one thing that helps revitalize DeFi usage in the coming year.\nETH Price\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $1,200, down 2% in the last week.\nETH has seen some decline recently | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Shubham Dhage on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Arcane Research"}, {"date": "2022-12-30 15:00:00", "entity": ["ford", "mobi", "vehicle identity standard", "bmw", "coinweb", "bmw", "bmw", "coinweb", "bmw", "coinweb", "coinweb", "dlt", "bmw", "car", "bmw", "bnb chain", "coinweb", "bmw", "x coinweb", "coinweb", "bmw", "coinweb", "bmw", "bnb", "bmw leasing"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Car manufacturing company BMW has integrated blockchain solutions through BNB Chain and Coinweb for its loyalty program.\nBMW x Coinweb Partnership\nThe luxury car brand has partnered with blockchain company Coinweb to integrate blockchain technology into its organization.

As a cryptocurrency with its own public blockchain, Dogecoin is paraded as a decentralized network; however, a review of its top wallet addresses by U.Today proved otherwise.\nDrawing on data from CoinMarketCap, the top 10 wallet Dogecoin addresses currently hold a total of 48.02% of the coin's supply. Dogecoin's total supply, according to on-chain data, is pegged at 132,670,764,300 units, and the biggest holder controls exactly 25.28% of this number.\nOf the total addresses on the network, which comes in at 4,508,886, the top 20 wallets control 54.76% of the supply, while the top 50 addresses hold 62.96% of the supply. This negates the idea of decentralization that seeks to distribute the token uniformly to as many of the wallet holders as possible.\nTo give a better overview of the centralization of Dogecoin, Bitcoin's top 10 wallet addresses control just a total of 5.38% of the coin's current total supply of 19,247,075. Also, the top 100 coins for BTC hold just 13.51% of the supply, against 67.55% for the meme coin.\nSusceptibility to price manipulation\nOne of the major dangers of supply centralization for a digital currency is its susceptibility to price manipulation. The biggest holders of Dogecoin can significantly impact the price of the coin when they offload their bags and can enhance the pump-and-dump narrative that DOGE is known for.\nWhile the centralization concern is a major one for Dogecoin, community members have been requesting that the coin switch to the proof-of-stake (PoS) model like Ethereum, a transition rumor that U.Today reported to have been refuted by one of the cryptocurrency's lead developers.\nAt the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.06783, down 4.29% in the past 24 hours."}, {"date": "2022-12-30 12:54:00", "entity": ["bithumb exchange", "bithumb", "vidente co", "bithumb", "bithumb", "inbiogen company", "vidente", "park", "park", "u.", "money", "vidente", "bithumb", "wu", "bithumb exchange"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Top executive of company closely linked to Bithumb exchange, which is Bithumb's biggest shareholder, was found dead near his house\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

However, these largest wallets on the Ethereum chain contain a lot less Shiba Inu than they did last month and in the first half of December.\nOver the past few months, the amount of Shiba Inu coins held by the 100 biggest wallets on Ethereum has dropped roughly by half.\nWhales' SHIB holdings shrink massively\nWhaleStats data on the website shows that the total amount of Shiba Inu held by the largest ETH investors stands at $44,294,390 worth of SHIB. This is about a million USD in this meme crypto more than on Thursday. At the moment, this is the equivalent of 5,536,571,068,398 – 1.99% of their comprised crypto portfolio in total.\nStill, at the end of November, this figure was twice as big and constituted around $80,000,000. In early December, they held around $74 million.\nOverall, since the FTX crash in the early days of November, the price of SHIB has slumped significantly, \"added another zero\" to its price and is now trading at $0.000008011.

At the current price, BTC has a year-to-date (YTD) performance of -65%, topped only by 2018 when the price lost -73% in one year.\nAs Arcane Research notes in its year-end report for 2022, physical gold (-1% YTD) has significantly outperformed digital gold, Bitcoin, in a period of high inflation. As a result, the analytics firm notes that the digital gold narrative was premature.\nAs Arcane Research notes, the crypto winter was essentially fueled by tightening macroeconomic conditions and crypto-specific leverage and miserable risk management by core market participants. BTC had followed the U.S. equity markets due to its high correlation.\n“Apart from two distinct events in 2022, BTC followed U.S. equities very closely. The two outliers of June (3AC, Celsius etc.) and November (FTX), are responsible for the entire underperformance of BTC vs. the U.S. equities,” the report states, displaying the following chart.\nBitcoin Predictions For 2023\nFor the coming year 2023, Arcane Research expects that contagion effects will “probably” continue in early 2023. “[B]ut we view it as likely that the majority of 2023 will be less frantic and borderline uneventful compared to the last three years,” Arcane Research predicts.\nWith that in mind, the firm expects Bitcoin to trade in a “mostly flat range” in 2023, but to finish the year with a higher price than it did at the start.\nBitcoin’s current drawdowns closely resemble the bear market patterns of previous cycles, Arcane Research elicits. While the 2018 bear market lasted 364 days from peak to end, the 2014-15 bear market lasted 407 days. The current cycle is on its 376th day. This puts the ongoing bear market exactly between the duration in both previous cycles.\n“If a new bottom is reached in 2023, this will be the longest-lasting BTC drawdown ever,” the firm said and further elaborated that there are quite a few potential catalysts for a renowned bull market:\nThe FTX proceedings may incentivize more rapid progress with regulations, and we view both positive signals related to U.S. spot BTC ETF launches and more coherent classifications of tokens as a plausible outcome by the end of the year, with exchange tokens being particularly exposed for potential security classifications.\nRegarding Grayscale’s Bitcoin spot ETF application, February 3 will be an important date for the industry when the three-judge panel will rule on the SEC complaint.\nIn addition, Arcane Research expects another catalyst from Europe: namely, the passage of the MiCA Act by the European Parliament in February 2023. The core prediction for 2023 remains that Bitcoin will recover despite the tightening macroeconomic situation and that now is “an excellent area to build gradual BTC exposure.”\nHowever, the start of 2023 could be bumpy as trading volumes and volatility decline in a much duller market than in the past three years. In summary, Arcane Research therefore estimates:\nAs we advance into the next year, patience and long-term positioning will be key.\nAt press time, the BTC price traded at $16,497, facing further downward pressure, probably due to tax harvesting by year-end."}, {"date": "2022-12-30 11:30:00", "entity": ["rbi", "rbi", "rbi", "central bank digital currencies", "reserve bank of india", "rbi", "reserve bank of india"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Reserve Bank of India has released its Financial Stability Report, in which it says that crypto needs the same regulation applicable to traditional finance.\nNo change on crypto from the RBI\nNoises coming out of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have not changed in tone at all as regards all things crypto. The latest salvo to be fired at crypto came in the form of the bank’s Financial Stability Report.\nIt does seem rather odd, given the incoming recession, which was undoubtedly caused by central banks printing far too much currency. This in turn sent inflation spiralling up across the world, impacting on the ordinary citizen by reducing their purchasing power by another huge amount.\nTherefore, for the leading bank in India to spend so much time and effort on maligning such a tiny and still fairly inconsequential asset as crypto might appear to be a case of bringing in a cannon to kill a fly.\nHowever, the RBI is not alone in its endeavours. Central banks from across the world also seem eager to join in the crypto-bashing, given that crypto is in the midst of a particularly harsh bear market, and various centralised exchanges have collapsed, they are having quite a field day.\nDespite the entire crypto market cap amounting to less than $800 billion, the RBI said in its Financial Stability Report:\n\"Although the crypto assets market remains volatile, there have not yet been any spillovers onto the stability of the formal financial system. The accumulated experience, however, suggests that they form an unstable ecosystem and there is growing evidence that they remain highly concentrated and interconnected,\"\n3 options to deal with crypto\nThe RBI stated in the report that in its view there were 3 options that might be applied to crypto. The first option, and the only one with any vestige of credibility, is to regulate crypto the same as any traditional finance company.\nCrypto is a completely new asset class that has brought incredible innovation to finance. Should it be allowed to continue with fair and well thought out regulation that protects investors while encouraging more innovation, then there wouldn’t be many who would argue with it.\nOption number two is to completely ban it given (in the bank’s view) that it has “negligible” real-life use cases. However, the bank does acknowledge that other countries might choose not to go along with this given their differing regulatory approaches and their laws on individual rights.\nOption number three was to just allow crypto to collapse and to let it become “systemically irrelevant”. For all that, crypto undeniably has use cases and investors will be keeping an eye on it as fiat currencies slip further in value and begin to lose trust across wider populations.\nWith this in mind, it could be expected that central banks and regulatory agencies across the world might seek to combine their approach to crypto in an effort to crush it enough that their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) can be implemented.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Vetle Lunde, senior analyst at Arcane Research has published a detailed analysis of this.\n“No matter how you look at it in terms of trading activity, Binance dominates the crypto market,” the analyst says, further stating that the exchange led by Changpeng Zhao is the clear winner of 2022.\nAs the Arcane Research analyst notes, Binance captures 92% of the Bitcoin spot volume. Remarkably, the exchange occupied only 42% of BTC spot volume in January 2022. After the exchange removed trading fees on its BTC spot pairs this summer, the growth exploded.\n“We have to go all the way back to Mt. Gox’s heydays to find a period where a single exchange dominated in a similar fashion,” Lunde claimed.\nBinance’s Dominance Increased Across The Board\nBut not only the spot volume but also the perp volume puts Binance in a different league than all other crypto exchanges. According to Arcane Research, the exchange is responsible for 66% of the global perpetual swap volume of all cryptocurrencies. OKX with 16% and Bybit with 13% are trailing far behind on the next ranks.\nCZ’s exchange also represented 55% of perp trading volume until November, but after the collapse of FTX, more or less all of the perp trading market share was taken by the exchange, leading to rapid and prevalent growth in market dominance, Lunde says.\nWith 49%, Binance is not much less dominant in global perp open interest, followed by Bybit with 23% and OKX with 20%. Similar to volumes, the exchanges’ dominance has gained the largest market share following the collapse of FTX.\nBinance also holds a whopping 61% of Bitcoin perp and futures volume. This makes the dominance for BTC almost as large as for all crypto perps. Remarkably, the exchange’s market share has grown steadily throughout the year. However, it is striking that “more or less all of the market share” flowed to the exchange in November following the collapse of FTX.\nIn contrast, Binance’s dominance is less pronounced when it comes to the open interest of BTC perps and futures, where the exchange is responsible for 30%, followed by OKX (24%), Bybit (19%), and the CME (16%). “Nonetheless, Binance has been the market leader throughout the year maintaining a market share of 25-35% of the OI in BTC derivatives,” Lunde explained.\nApart from these stats, Binance has been able to gather other achievements in 2022, according to Arcane Research’s senior analyst. BUSD gained market share in the stablecoin industry (from 11% to 14%) and BNB outperformed BTC and ETH by a wide margin.\nMoreover, Binance continued to grow its employee base while the entire industry was forced to lay off workers. As Lunde explained, the exchange was able to double its headcount while others laid off half their workforce or went bankrupt.\nMeanwhile, the BNB price weakened over the past few weeks after numerous rumors about Binance worried investors.

With a price drop of 96.2% from its all-time high, investors had to cope with a harsh price correction. One of the main reasons for the crash can be seen in the insolvency of FTX.\nSince Sam Bankman-Fried’s investment firm Alameda Research still has a considerable stack of SOL in its portfolio, the situation is unlikely to improve, at least in the short term. New CEO John Ray will inevitably have to liquidate this position in order to pay out customers who have been harmed.\nIn the wake of these negative developments, SOL’s price slipped to $9.13 at press time. But Chris Burniske, partner at Placeholder VC, shared some reasons why Solana is far from dead. As the former head of ARK Invest Crypto explained, he was recently asked by Vitalik Buterin what he likes about Solana.\nBurniske replied that for him, Solana has a “unique flavor of hardcore devotees & nerds,” meaning that they will drive innovation apart from Ethereum:\nSome of the devotees are hardware junkies, others are network optimization nerds, the validator community is crazy committed, and generally, a layer deeper than the financial opportunists are builders that get truly excited by Anatoly Yakovenko’s [co-founder of Solana Labs] vision.\nAccording to Burniske, Yakovenko himself is also one of the reasons he believes in Solana. “He is admittedly more pragmatic than Vitalik,” the analyst said, further explaining that this approach is guided by the goal of making the “blockchain accessible to billions of people.”\nIn terms of the developer ecosystem, Burniske asserts that it provides a perfect mix of crypto backend experts and Web2 front-end developers – “crypto needs more of them.” At the same time, the analyst notes that the Solana ecosystem isn’t just made up of die-hard crypto devotees, so it’s harder in a bear market “when some of the web2 people lose their nerve.”\nAs for the technology, Burniske is also very optimistic, saying SVM is more powerful than EVM. “While it has competitors, I anticipate Solana will be *the* blockchain ecosystem known for consensus near the speed of light […] and that will attract builders that prioritize speed w/ sufficient decentralization,” the analyst concluded.\nSolana Price Prediction For 2023\nThe start of 2023 is likely to be a slow one for the Solana price due to selling pressure from John Ray. However, once investors rebuild confidence, the $10.94 level should become key. Then, the level at $11.93 becomes interesting, as the 1-day chart shows.\nHowever, a first recovery rally is likely to falter. If a breakout occurs, the six-week resistance at $14.90 will come into focus and could be of key importance in determining whether SOL has the potential for larger price gains. If so, the area between $18.31 and $19.94 could provide the next resistance. Once again, investors are likely to want to take more profits here.\nIf SOL also succeeds in breaking through this zone in 2023, a retest of the $25.87 mark would be possible, an area that served as extremely important support back in June. Here, however, a significant price drop towards the south is also to be expected.\nIf and when Solana will be able to reach the resistance at $38.78 again in the year is currently questionable. Only if the bulls return to the crypto market as a result of a Fed pivot with investors developing deep confidence in Solana again, this price level should also be able to fall.\nFeatured image from Guerrillabuzz Blockchain / Unsplash, Charts from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-30 09:11:00", "entity": ["ethereum", "cosmos", "ethereum", "ethereum", "cosmos", "ethereum", "cosmos", "digital currencies", "coin", "atom", "coingecko", "coin", "atom", "cosmos cosmos", "atom", "cosmos", "atom", "atom", "coin", "atom", "cosmos"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral"], "content": "Cosmos (ATOM) is seeing impressive buying push that may see it beat its 30-day high before year's end\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

Cosmos (ATOM) came off as one of the few digital currencies whose growing ecosystem has helped it maintain a good level of resilience in the face of massive sell-offs.\nAt the time of writing, the coin is changing hands at $9.28, up by 0.5% over the past 24 hours.

Data from CoinGecko shows the coin is down by 8.8% month-over-month and by 66.8% over the past year.\nDespite its apparent bearish outlook, Cosmos (ATOM) is showing signs of a massive rebound as the year is coming to an end. While most HODLers are looking to take off some profits with scheduled sell-offs, ATOM investors are beginning to show signs of enhanced bullish activities, as shown in the uptick in the coin's trading volume over the past 24 hours.\nPer the current outlook, ATOM is on track to retest its 30-day high of $10.55 should its current buying momentum be sustained.\nStill Ethereum killer?\nCosmos was designed as an antidote to \"slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful\" proof-of-work protocols. Prior to The Merge of the Ethereum protocol, Cosmos was projected as a highly functional network capable of solving some of the redundancies the Ethereum blockchain exhibits.\nWith Ethereum now running on the proof-of-stake (PoS) model, Cosmos' Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus algorithm - a variant of the PoS - offers extra functionalities that allow it to surpass Ethereum.

We do not recommend investing money you cannot afford to lose.\nThe former lead of Ark Invest's cryptocurrency division says he is ready to support the dying Solana network and agrees with the most recent thread shared by Vitalik Buterin. He also has his own reasons, as described in a series of Twitter posts.\nFirst of all, Burniske believes that Solana's ecosystem is filled with talent and developers who will be able to push innovation on the network independently from what we can find in Ethereum or Cosmos, even without the support of venture capital that has been pushing Solana's competitors forward.\n1/ Still longing $SOL while haters spinelessly pile onto the downside momentum. When @solana recovers, it's not me that will be haunted by the thought, \"Instead of jeering, I could have been buying $SOL ~$10.\" — Chris Burniske (@cburniske) December 30, 2022\nAccording to Burniske, some of the devotees of Solana are \"hardware junkies,\" and others are network optimization enthusiasts who are committed heavily to making Solana a better ecosystem. The validator community has also joined Solana not only because of the financial opportunities, but they are genuinely excited about what the whole system can achieve.\nBurniske also highlighted the personality behind the network, saying that Anatoly Yakovenko is more pragmatic than Vitalik Buterin or the founder of Cosmos, which may push some to believe that he has betrayed some of his crypto ideals, while in fact he is simply trying to build a more efficient future for blockchain.\nFrom a technical perspective, creators on Solana often blend Web2 and Web3 technologies, which means they understand the backend of what they create and have enough skills to produce front-ends and make the network friendlier to the mainstream.\nThe period Solana is going through right now is complicated, but mistakes made along the way will only make it stronger, believes Burniske. Unfortunately, there is nothing to do with Solana but wait and see: either a revival and morphing into Ethereum 2.0 or the same fate as networks like EOS."}, {"date": "2022-12-30 07:20:00", "entity": ["coti", "coti", "ethereum", "coti", "coti", "coti", "coti", "coti", "bridge", "coti", "coti", "cardano", "stablecoin", "coti", "cardano", "stablecoin", "hard fork", "coti", "mainnet", "cardano summit", "stablecoin", "coti", "djed", "stablecoin", "coti", "djed", "cardano", "stablecoin", "stablecoin", "mainnet", "coti", "djed", "terraus", "coti"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral"], "content": "Blockchain Protocol Coti, the protocol behind Cardano’s new stablecoin, has announced that it has successfully upgraded its network, MultiDAG 2.0.\nThe upgrade aims to transition its ecosystem from a single-currency infrastructure to a multi-token network.\nCoti’s MultiDAG 2.0 Mainnet Goes Live\nThe DeFi protocol behind Cardano’s new Djed stablecoin has announced the successful hard fork MultiDAG 2.0, aiming to transition the ecosystem from a single-currency infrastructure to a multi-token network. Coti revealed the launch of the mainnet on the 29th of December, during which Explorer 2.0 and the Bridge 2.0 app were also deployed. The team behind a protocol released a statement stating,\n“This launch signifies a massive step for the crypto industry, as well as COTI, as the MultiDAG 2.0 will increase the growth of the widespread adoption of crypto payments for enterprises that are yet to adopt crypto payment solutions. The transition from a single currency infrastructure to a multi-token network is an exciting step for us, and we’re glad to have your support on this important path.”\nMultiDAG 2.0\nMultiDAG 2.0 leverages the COTI MultiDAG (CMD) standard, which facilitates the issuance of tokens on the COTI Trustchain. This is similar to the concept of ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. However, in the case of the COTI Trustchain, the issuance takes place on a single DAG. The MultiDAG 2.0 release will help enhance Coti’s position in helping enterprises launch their own Private Payment Network (PPN), which would also include the issuance of CMD-branded payment tokens, CMD-branded loyalty tokens, and more.\n“The launch of the MultiDAG 2.0 protocol heralds the full transition of COTI from a single currency infrastructure to a multi-token network. We believe COTI is uniquely positioned to serve enterprises, enabling them to launch their own Private Payment Network (PPN), which includes the issuance of CMD [COTI MultiDAG] branded payment tokens, issuance of CMD branded loyalty tokens, and more.”\nCoti added that the new tokens would retain the same capabilities of the Trustchain in terms of security, scalability, and throughput, helping manage any requirement of enterprises. Additionally, the Bridge 2.0 app released along with the protocol also comes with a refund feature, allowing users to apply for a refund in case a swap fails due to technical difficulties.\nChange In Fee Model\nCOTI also announced a change in its fee model. The firm revealed that deposit fees would see a decrease of 50%. Meanwhile, withdrawal fees will see a switch from a set price to a dynamic one. However, the early withdrawal fee will remain intact. Other changes in the fee include a fixed multiplier charge which is applicable to multiplied deposits, and a liquidation fee between 1% to 5%, which will also be applicable to multiplied deposits. According to the team, the new fee model will go into effect on the 15th of January, 2023.\nCoti’s Association With Djed Stablecoin\nThe Coti ecosystem is also heavily involved with Djed, the Cardano ecosystem’s new stablecoin. The protocol is the official issuer of the over-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin, which is expected to launch on the mainnet in January 2023. The co-founder of Coti, Shahaf Bar-Geffen, is quite optimistic about the upcoming launch of Djed, despite the catastrophic failures of previous algorithmic stablecoins such as TerraUSD (UST). He shared his views on Djed when speaking at the Cardano summit, stating that he expected the stablecoin to act as a “safe haven” in the Cardano network.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A death cross occurs when the long-term moving average moves above the short-term moving average.\nIn the case of the Algorand price, the 50-Simple Moving Average (SMA) had crossed over the 20-SMA line.

MACD indicates price momentum and reversals; the green signal bar was tied to buy signals.\nThis could mean buyers can re-enter the market now as ALGO could reverse its price.

Another 1,000 of the NFTs were kept by the project’s creators. Each $99 collectible served as a contest entry to win prizes and perks, such as dinner or a meet-and-greet with Trump.\nThe NFTs were widely mocked as a cash grab, and even criticized by some of Trump’s own supporters. Some of the artwork elements were apparently stolen from online apparel imagery, plus Trump’s team is alleged to have held onto a disproportionate amount of the rare NFTs in the collection. Some initial buyers complained of technical hitches, too.\nStill, the buzz fueled secondary market demand for a few days thereafter, as some NFT “degen” traders saw an opportunity to profit from flipping the controversial assets. But the hype has been short-lived, with prices and trading volume crashing just days after the launch. And as sales data shows, the market isn’t getting any hungrier for Trump’s digital cards.\nTrump, who was previously opposed to cryptocurrencies, said in a recent interview that the NFT artwork was “sort of cute,” and that he “didn’t view it as an investment.”\nTrump’s initial NFT sale raked in over $4 million and sold out within 24 hours. All told, the project has generated about $9.8 million to date in secondary trading volume, with Trump’s team taking a 10% cut of sales made through marketplaces that honor creator royalties.\nAD\nAD"}, {"date": "2022-12-29 23:00:54", "entity": ["ronin", "wormhole", "nomad bridge", "beanstalk farms", "wintermute", "tradingview", "com binance", "bsc", "crypto. com", "ftx", "department of justice", "ftx", "ftx", "forbes", "tradingview. com", "chainalys"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Bad actors are now almost synonymous with the crypto space given the number of scams and hacks perpetuated on an almost daily basis. So far in the year 2022, these bad actors have come out on top, beating out previous years’ records. With $3 billion stolen already in 2022, they have had a very ‘productive year.’\nBillions Of Dollars Moved Through Crypto Hacks\nA Forbes report details the hacks of 2022 and how much these attackers have been able to steal this year alone. Citing a Chainalysis report, it explains that over the course of the year, hackers stole $3 billion from 125 hacks. The majority of these had been from decentralized finance (DeFi) attacks alone.\nWhile the crypto industry is still relatively young, the DeFi space is even younger, only coming into prominence just about a year ago. This means that security protocols have not been completely figured out yet, leaving room for attackers to exploit them for personal benefits. This is not helped by the fact that these DeFi protocols are pushed out in rapid succession without adequate tests for security measures.\nThe report details the platforms which had lost the most to these hacks. An alarming fact was that $1.48 billion was lost in only five hacks in the year. These include the Ronin Network which lost $625 million and was attributed to North Korean hackers.\nNext was Wormhole Network losing a whopping $325 million. Another $190 million was stolen when the Nomad bridge was exploited a couple of months ago, the third-largest for the year. Coming in fourth and fifth place were Beanstalk Farms which was exploited for $182 million and the Wintermute hack that saw attackers make way with $160 million.\nTogether, these five exploits accounted for almost half of all of the funds lost to hacks this year.\nMarket cap drops to $758 billion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com\nBinance also saw its own fair share of the action when a bridge that connected BSC and the Beacon Chain was exploited. At first, reports were that the hacker had made off with over $500 million but the exchange was able to recover some of the funds, leaving about $110 million lost in the hack. However, the centralized exchange itself was not breached.\nAs for the centralized exchanges that were breached, Crypto.com comes first with its $35 million hack that was recorded at the start of the year. FTX was the next in line about 11 months later when unauthorized transactions on the exchange saw over $370 million stolen. The U.S. Department of Justice is now reportedly investigating the FTX hack. Luckily, these were the only hacks for centralized exchanges for the year which hold considerably more cryptocurrencies than their decentralized counterparts.\nWith the FTX hack, the amount stolen has surpassed the previous year’s figure of $327 million. This is the fourth-highest coming behind 2014, 2016, and 2018.\nFeatured image from Forbes, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-29 21:44:18", "entity": ["coin", "solana", "coingecko", "solana", "solana", "coingecko", "sol", "sol", "solana", "solana", "serum", "solend", "ftx", "solana", "solana", "solana", "ethereum", "polygon", "solana", "ftx", "alameda", "research", "sol", "solana ecosystem", "solana", "sol", "solana", "coin"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "In brief Solana has shed 16% of its value in the last 24 hours, continuing its recent string of losses and falling out of the top 20 coins by market cap.\nSOL’s price hasn’t been this low since February 2021.

As of this writing, Solana is ranked 22nd on the platform's market tracker.\nSolana had until recently been ranked in the top 10, and its market cap peaked above $76 billion in November 2021.

However, the once-soaring cryptocurrency—which Decrypt named its coin of the year in 2021 following a surge in value and chain activity—has faced a string of challenges this year.\nThe most pressing, of course, was the downfall of FTX and Alameda Research. Both firms had invested heavily in SOL and the Solana ecosystem, and Sam Bankman-Fried—the well-known co-founder of both companies—was an outspoken advocate of Solana.\nWhen FTX collapsed in November, the entire cryptocurrency market took a hit—but Solana was battered more significantly than other major coins, shedding much more value as the close association with Bankman-Fried and his companies appeared to take a toll on Solana.\nThe blockchain platform has also weathered technical challenges in 2022, with multiple periods of network downtime. And just this week, the creator of two of the most popular Solana NFT projects—DeGods and y00ts—said that they will be bridged to Ethereum and Polygon, respectively, due in part to feeling constrained by the declining Solana ecosystem.\nAD\nAD\nSolana-based tokens like Serum (SRM) and Solend (SLND) are also down sharply today."}, {"date": "2022-12-29 21:33:51", "entity": ["celsi", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "ftx", "ftx", "binance", "ftx", "binance", "ftx", "binance", "ftx", "t. co", "ftx", "kraken", "powell", "kraken", "celsius network", "celsius celsi", "compass", "algoran", "algoran", "algorand", "fifa", "napster", "algorand", "ftx", "alameda", "yuga labs", "genesis", "genesis trading", "ftx", "digital currency", "genesis", "gemini", "alameda research", "alameda research", "trabucco", "genesis trading", "ftx", "genesis", "ftx _", "ftx", "ftx", "ftx us", "celsiusnetwork", "t. co", "##us celsius", "celsius", "yuga labs", "activision blizza", "saga", "yuga", "yuga labs", "compass", "dynamics mining", "compass", "compass mining", "dynamics", "compass", "ftx", "securities & exchange commission", "ftx", "u. s. commodity futures trading commission", "cftc", "celsius", "##sky parity technologies", "ethereum", "parity technologies", "parity", "bloomberg"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "As the crypto market declined in 2022, the departures began en masse. Several high-profile CEO stepped down from their respective roles at the head of crypto-centric firms in 2022, including Jesse Powell of Kraken, Michael Saylor of MicroStrategy, Alex Mashinsky of Celsius, and Sam Bankman-Fried of FTX.\nThe reasons given for stepping down vary—the bankruptcy of their company for some, for others, the volatility of the crypto market or a transition to a new phase for the firm.\nAD\nAD\nThe collapse of Terra sent ripples throughout the crypto universe, and several companies, including Three Arrows Capital, Voyager Digital, and FTX became insolvent and ceased operations.\nWhile Terraform Labs CEO Do Kwon did not step down or resign—meanwhile becoming an international fugitive—the leadership at other companies began to fall like dominos. Here's a look at some of the biggest departures this year in order of when they happened.\nCompass Mining CEO Whitney Gibbs\nBitcoin mining hardware company Compass Mining saw the first big move in June as the crypto market imploded, when co-founder and CEO Whitney \"Whit\" Gibbs resigned alongside Chief Finance Officer Jodie Fisher.\nCompass had come under fire for allegedly failing to pay utility and hosting bills tied to a facility in Maine owned by Dynamics Mining. \"All you had to [do] was pay $250k for 3 months of power consumption,\" Dynamics tweeted at Compass in June.\n\"Compass Mining was created to make mining easy and accessible,\" the company said following the resignations. \"We recognize that there have been multiple setbacks and disappointments that have detracted from that objective.\"\nThe firm ultimately took its case against Dynamics to court, however—and on December 30, Compass announced that it had won the case, obtaining a nearly $1.5 million judgment. Compass said that it \"is not clear whether [it] will be able to collect.\"\nAlgorand CEO Steven Kokinos\nIn July, Algorand CEO Steven Kokinos departed the company behind the layer-1 blockchain platform of the same name, saying that he was eager to explore \"other interests.\" Algorand, which has attracted the likes of FIFA and Napster to build on its platform, promoted COO Sean Ford to be its interim CEO.\nKokinos, who will serve as a senior advisor to Algorand into mid-2023, isn't going far: he said he planned to work more closely with projects that are building on the platform.\nAD\nAD\nGenesis Trading CEO Michael Moro\nCrypto broker Genesis took a couple hard hits in 2022, including being the biggest creditor of the collapsed Three Arrows Capital—to the tune of $2.36 billion—and being impacted by FTX's downfall as well. In August, following the Three Arrows revelations, CEO Michael Moro stepped down.\n“It has been an honor to lead Genesis for nearly a decade, and I look forward to supporting the company’s next phase of growth,” Moro said upon the announcement, noting that he would advise the firm through the transition.\nGenesis announced a 20% reduction in staff at the same time, and named COO Derar Islim as interim CEO. In November, Genesis Trading halted all withdrawals from its lending arm due to the impact of the FTX collapse. The Digital Currency Group-owned Genesis reportedly owes Gemini Earn customers some $900 million, among other liabilities.\nAlameda Research Co-CEO Sam Trabucco\nIn August, Sam Trabucco, co-CEO of Alameda Research, stepped down, citing a desire to relax. Trabucco's co-CEO Caroline Ellison continued as Alameda's sole CEO until the firm filed for bankruptcy alongside FTX in November.\n\"I can't personally continue to justify the time investment of being a central part of Alameda,\" Trabucco said of his departure. \"Everyone works really hard here, and spending a 'normal' amount of time at work is tricky—especially when you're trying to be a leader.\"\nIn hindsight now, of course, there are questions about how much Trabucco knew about Alameda's trading losses this summer and how FTX customer funds were used to help plug the hole in its balance sheet.\nLast year, when @SBF_FTX announced that Caroline and I were Alameda's co-CEOs, the goal for all involved was to bring titles in line with reality -- the two of us had been acting as CEOs for quite some time, and we wanted our outside image to reflect that. — Sam Trabucco (@AlamedaTrabucco) August 24, 2022\nMicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor\nProlific Bitcoiner Michael Saylor also stepped down from his position as CEO of cloud software company MicroStrategy in August. While no longer CEO, Saylor retains a leadership position as executive chairman for the company he co-founded in 1989.\nWhile MicroStrategy's core focus is not on cryptocurrency-related services, the company has rapidly become known for holding the largest stash of Bitcoin by a public company. As of December 28, when it last disclosed its BTC holdings, MicroStrategy said that it held about 132,500 BTC—or $2.2 billion worth today. But the company spent over $4 billion to acquire that BTC since 2020.\nWhen announcing the move in August, Saylor said that he would continue to lead its \"bitcoin acquisition strategy.\" He added, \"My focus is bitcoin advocacy and education, like with the Bitcoin Mining Council, and being spokesperson and envoy to global bitcoin community.\"\nAD\nAD\nFTX US President Brett Harrison\nIn September, FTX US President Brett Harrison suddenly stepped down to move into an advisory role with the firm. Harrison announced his resignation on Twitter, saying he intends to stay in the crypto industry.\n\"I'm remaining in the industry with the goal of removing technological barriers to full participation in and maturation of global crypto markets, both centralized and decentralized,\" he wrote.\n1/ An announcement: I’m stepping down as President of @FTX_Official. Over the next few months I’ll be transferring my responsibilities and moving into an advisory role at the company. — Brett Harrison (@BrettHarrison88) September 27, 2022\n\"Until then, I'll be assisting Sam [Bankman-Fried] and the team with this transition to ensure FTX ends the year with all its characteristic momentum,\" he said, attempting to sound optimistic. Unfortunately, Harrison's optimism did not save FTX, who has claimed to be separate from FTX US, from filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November.\nHarrison commented on the FTX fallout in mid-December without mentioning his former employer by name, tweeting that he \"had no personal experience with harmful, consequential betrayal in my life until recently.\nHe added that he \"can only thank God I will never know or recognize in myself that kind of pathological, corrupting selfishness. It is malign and poisonous.\" Harrison also said that he's excited to start his new company and that he \"will not abandon this industry.\"\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell then stepped down in September. Powell said that as Kraken grew, running the company became more of a drain and \"less fun.\" He said he plans to stay engaged with the company he founded in 2011.\nIn June, Kraken was embroiled in controversy when it took a firm stance on what was described as \"anti-woke\" sentiment, instead urging staff to focus on crypto instead of cultural and diversity issues. In a much-debated Twitter thread, Powell suggested that any employees \"triggered\" by the mandate should leave the company.\nIn November, Kraken announced that it would cut roughly 1,100 employees, reducing its headcount by 30%, citing broad economic concerns and the effects of the ongoing crypto bear market.\n9/ Most people don't care and just want to work, but they can't be productive while triggered people keep dragging them in to debates and therapy sessions. The answer for us was to just lay out the culture doc and say: agree and commit, disagree and commit, or take the cash✌️ — Jesse Powell (@jespow) June 15, 2022\nAD\nAD\nCelsius CEO Alex Mashinsky\nCelsius CEO Alex Mashinsky resigned as the head of the bankrupt crypto lender Celsius Network in September.\n\"I elected to resign my post as CEO of Celsius Network today,\" said Mashinsky in a statement. \"Nevertheless, I will continue to maintain my focus on working to help the community unite behind a plan that will provide the best outcome for all creditors—which is what I have been doing since the company filed for bankruptcy.\"\nIn his resignation, Mashinsky said that his continued role as CEO had become an increasing distraction and that he is sorry for the \"difficult financial circumstances\" faced by the Celsius community. Mashinsky's resignation came two months after Celsius filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nMoments ago, @CelsiusNetwork filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 protection and announced that the company initiated a financial restructuring. https://t.co/vf5wsT6TMp — Celsius (@CelsiusNetwork) July 14, 2022\nCelsius' troubles began after the company paused all customer withdrawals in June, citing liquidity issues. This announcement prompted Alabama, Kentucky, New Jersey, Texas, and Washington regulators to open investigations into the company.\nIn September, Celsius co-founder Daniel Leon resigned from his role as chief strategy officer of the embattled company. While Leon left with 32,600 shares of Celsius stock acquired in February 2018 and dividends, Financial Times uncovered that Mashinsky withdrew $10 million from the company's account in May before the platform halted user withdrawals.\nParity Technologies CEO Gavin Wood\nGavin Wood, Ethereum co-founder and CEO of Polkadot maker Parity Technologies, stepped down from the role in October. Although Wood departed the CEO position, he remains Parity's majority shareholder and chief architect.\nAccording to Bloomberg, Wood decided to step down because serving as chief executive had limited his ability to pursue \"eternal happiness.\" Polkadot's DOT cryptocurrency is now down 92% from its November 2021 peak price, outpacing the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum on that front.\nFTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried\nOn November 11, one-time crypto icon Sam Bankman-Fried resigned as CEO of FTX as the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nBankman-Fried's resignation came nearly a week after Binance CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao said on Twitter that the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange would liquidate its entire position in FTX's FTT token. Just days later, Binance—which signed a non-binding letter of intent to acquire FTX amid the liquidity crunch that ensued—said it would not follow through after completing due diligence. Binance was an early investor in FTX in 2019.\nAD\nAD\nAs a result of corporate due diligence, as well as the latest news reports regarding mishandled customer funds and alleged US agency investigations, we have decided that we will not pursue the potential acquisition of https://t.co/FQ3MIG381f. — Binance (@binance) November 9, 2022\nNew FTX CEO John J. Ray III—who was brought in to help manage the bankruptcy process—has taken steps to distance FTX from its former leader, saying that Bankman-Fried does not speak for the company and has no active role.\nBankman-Fried has since been arrested and charged by U.S. federal prosecutors as well as the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC), plus he's been sued alongside FTX and Alameda by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). He was recently extradited from the Bahamas to the United States and released from custody via a $250 million bond agreement.\nAlameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison\nCaroline Ellison, the remaining CEO of Alameda Research after the resignation of Sam Trabucco in August, was terminated from her position when FTX and several of its subsidiaries, including Alameda, filed for bankruptcy in November.\nEllison became the focus of media scrutiny not only for the questionable business practices of Alameda Research and FTX, but also for a Tumblr blog that expressed views on polyamorous relationship dynamics and Race Science. Her relationship with Bankman-Fried has also come under scrutiny, not only as a case of nepotism but also as the potential involvement of Ellison in FTX's alleged financial crimes.\nShe has since flipped on her former ally and and lover, pleading guilty to charges from federal prosecutors and the SEC alike with plans to cooperate and provide information regarding Bankman-Fried and his companies' alleged wrongdoing. Ellison reportedly told a judge that she knew what she was doing at Alameda was both wrong and illegal.\nYuga Labs CEO Nicole Muniz\nAfter the especially dramatic entries above, the final CEO move on this list is decidedly tame by comparison. Nicole Muniz, the first CEO of Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs, said that she will depart the role in the first half of 2023 to clear the way for a new chief executive, Daniel Alegre.\nAlegre joined after being President and COO of Activision Blizzard, the gaming giant behind franchises like Call of Duty and Candy Crush Saga. The move signaled Yuga's growing embrace of Web3 gaming with Otherside. Muniz will stay on as a partner and advisor after the move is completed. Yuga Labs raised $450 million at a $4 billion valuation in March.\n\"I am thrilled that we found Daniel to keep up the momentum and bring his gaming expertise to hugely ambitious projects like Otherside,\" she said in a statement.\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to include details of the Compass Mining court verdict.\nAD\nAD"}, {"date": "2022-12-29 21:15:50", "entity": ["ali babacan", "deva", "cbdc", "shapeshift", "decrypt", "central bank", "cbdc", "cbdc", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "bitcoin", "cbdc", "central bank", "reserve bank of india", "bitcoin", "turkey ’ s central bank", "central bank of republic of turkey", "cbrt", "cbrt"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Turkey’s central bank announced today that it had completed the first set of tests for its long-planned digital currency.\nThe Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) said that it plans to continue running tests for its digital lira next year.\nAD\nAD\n“The CBRT will continue to run the limited, closed-circuit pilot tests with technology stakeholders in the first quarter of 2023,” the statement read. “Findings obtained from these tests will be shared with the public via a comprehensive evaluation report.”\nUpcoming phases will explore “the use of distributed ledger technologies in payment systems and the integration of these technologies with instant payment systems,” the announcement read.\nTurkey’s central bank has been working on its own CBDC—a digital version of a state’s fiat currency—for years. CBDCs are digital assets backed by a central bank, and are very different from the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Last month, news surfaced that Japan’s central bank was planning a CBDC experiment with the country’s megabanks. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India has proposed a phased pilot of its version of a digital rupee.\nChina is by far the furthest ahead of the major economies: citizens can already spend the digital yuan.\nTurkey makes for an interesting case study because the country’s money is one of the worst performing emerging market currencies: this year it lost 29% of its value.

But that's where the crypto industry stands at the close of 2022.\nThe second half of 2022 was a rocky time in this industry, to say the least, with most optimism eviscerated by the collapse of multiple crypto firms, Coinbase's stock hitting new low after new low, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust de-pegging by nearly 50% from its underlying asset, and a whole lot more crypto contagion.\nAD\nAD\nBut it wasn't all bad.\nEthereum executed one of its most highly-anticipated upgrades since the network's launch. Crypto is taking center stage in regulatory discussions in Europe and the United Kingdom. And major brands and corporations keep announcing news that show mainstream adoption. Here's our recap of July through December in cryptoland in 2022.\nEthereum completes the merge\nEthereum, the market’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, successfully transitioned from its proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism on August 15, with the landmark update bringing major changes to the network, including a reported 99.95% reduction in energy consumption and a 90% cut in ETH issuance.\nThe upgrade, also known as the merge, has been years in the making and suffered from several delays until the Ethereum Foundation committed to a 2022 launch.\n“Proof-of-Stake has been a dream for the Ethereum ecosystem since pretty much the beginning,” said Buterin during the Ethereum Foundation’s viewing party, which was simultaneously viewed by more than 40,000 people.\nThe upgrade has forever changed both how ETH is created and how transactions on the Ethereum network are validated. Up until the moment of the merge, ETH was generated by mining, an energy-intensive process where mining machines directed heaps of computer power to solve complex mathematical puzzles.\nSince the merge, which some described as “the most important event in crypto history,” the network relies on validators staking ETH to achieve consensus and secure the network.\n3AC, Voyager, and Celsius file for bankruptcy\nAs the crypto contagion triggered by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem spread further, three big companies fell within a two-week period at the beginning of July.\nAD\nAD\nThe Singapore-based crypto investment firm Three Arrows Capital, also known as 3AC, was the first to file for Chapter 15 bankruptcy on July 2. The hedge fund, founded in 2012 and managed an estimated $10 billion, had positions in many of crypto’s largest projects and companies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Axie Infinity, and BlockFi.\nShortly before the bankruptcy, 3AC co-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu confirmed they took a $200 million loss from their UST and LUNA positions. Court documents published later in July revealed that 3AC owed a whopping $3.5 billion to 27 different companies, including Blockchain.com, Voyager Digital, and Genesis Global Trading.\nVoyager Digital, which earlier revealed it had a $661 million exposure to 3AC, became the next high-profile crypto firm to file for bankruptcy on July 6, followed by crypto lending platform Celsius, which officially announced its Chapter 11 filing on July 14.\nThe filing showed Celsius made “certain poor asset deployment decisions” as the company grew faster than it anticipated, leaving a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.\nCelsius’ CEO Alex Mashinsky resigned in September, saying that he’ll continue “working to help the community unite behind a plan that will provide the best outcome for all creditors.”\nSEC claims Coinbase lists unregistered securities\nIn a new court filing submitted on July 21, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claimed that at least nine cryptocurrencies listed on Coinbase are unregistered securities.\nAccording to the Commission, those tokens contain the \"hallmarks of the definition of a security,” including continuing representations by issuers and their management teams regarding the investment value of the tokens, the managerial efforts that contribute to the tokens' value, and the availability of secondary markets for trading the tokens.\nThe nine assets in question were AMP (AMP), Rally (RLY), DerivaDEX (DDX), XYO (XYO), Rari Governance Token (RGT), LCX (LCX), Powerledger (POWR), DFX Finance (DFX), and Kromatika (KROM).\nWhile certain rival exchanges, such as Binance's U.S. subsidiary, were quick to delist some of those assets to avoid similar issues with the financial regulator, Coinbase—despite reports of a SEC probe—denied any wrongdoing.\n“We are confident that our rigorous diligence process―a process the SEC has already reviewed―keeps securities off our platform, and we look forward to engaging with the SEC on the matter,” the company’s chief legal officer Paul Grewal said in response to the SEC's probe.\nShortly before that, SEC chair Gary Gensler argued that cryptocurrency exchanges should be regulated in the same manner as traditional securities exchanges.\nFeds sanction Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash\nIn one of the most high-profile cases of the year, the U.S. Treasury Department on August 8 announced sanctions against Tornado Cash, a privacy-focused Ethereum mixing service that helps users obfuscate transactions.\nAD\nAD\nCiting the illicit use of the tumbler by money launderers, including Lazarus Group, a North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, the body added the Tornado Cash website and a long list of Ethereum addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals list, banning American citizens from using the tool or transacting with these addresses.\nThe source code for the mixer was also removed from Github, followed by a Tornado Cash suspected developer’s arrest in the Netherlands.\nThe crypto community erupted following the news, with privacy advocates decrying the move as a declaration of war on those who simply write code. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin launched a stinging criticism of the move, identifying himself as someone who used the service to make donations to Ukraine’s cause.\nStill, Dutch officials insisted at the time that it \"may be punishable\" if a developer writes code “for the sole purpose of committing criminal acts.”\nSEC claims all Ethereum transactions fall under US jurisdiction\nOn September 19, the SEC filed charges against crypto influencer Ian Balina, alleging the Uganda-born entrepreneur failed to file a registration statement for his offering and sale of Sparkster's SPRK tokens in July 2018, while no exemption from registration was applicable.\nBalina also allegedly failed to disclose the compensation he received while promoting Sparkster’s initial coin offering (ICO) on social media, according to the SEC.\nHowever, the devil is in the details. In a bold move buried in the lawsuit’s 69th paragraph, the SEC also claimed it had the right to sue Balina not only because his case concerns transactions made in the United States but also because, according to the Commission, the entire Ethereum network falls under the U.S. government’s purview.\nAccording to the SEC, the ETH sent to Balina was “validated by a network of nodes on the Ethereum blockchain, which are clustered more densely in the United States than in any other country.”\nWhich, in the SEC’s logic, means that “as a result, those transactions took place in the United States.”\nTesla dumps 75% of its Bitcoin holdings\nTesla made headlines in February 2021, when it plowed $1.5 billion into Bitcoin after changing its investment policy in January to allow the firm to hold crypto.\nIn July 2022, the electric car manufacturer founded by Elon Musk revealed it sold 75% of its BTC holdings, worth approximately $936 million, with the shareholder letter stating that Bitcoin impairment had a negative impact on the firm’s profitability during the second quarter, when it posted $2.5 billion in operating income.\nDespite dumping most of its Bitcoin, Tesla was still holding $222 million worth of “digital assets” on its balance sheet as of the end of June.\nKraken CEO Jesse Powell steps down\nOn September 21, industry veteran Jesse Powell announced he’d be stepping down as CEO of Kraken, the popular crypto exchange.\n“I look forward to spending more of my time on the company’s products, user experience and broader industry advocacy,” said Powell, who founded Kraken in 2011.\nAD\nAD\nPowell, 42, who is being succeeded by Chief Operating Officer Dave Ripley, 45, will become chairman of the board. The transition is expected to take place over the next few months once a new COO is selected.\nCOIN keeps going lower\nAmid the bear market, Coinbase's stock has hit its lowest price since the company went public last year, with COIN falling 87.04% to $35.00, compared to $268.15 on December 21.\nThe stock hit a new low roughly a week later, dropping down to $32.40.\nCoinbase’s troubles are a result of a downturn in the broader macroeconomic environment, which has brought the crypto industry into a biting winter. Naturally, revenues at the firm have tumbled. The company reported net revenue of $576 million for the third quarter of 2022, a 28% decline from $803 million in the previous quarter.\nIf there is one person bullish on Coinbase, though, that would be Ark Invest’s chief Cathie Wood,\nwho’s been buying\nthe firm’s shares throughout the year.\nThe great Grayscale Bitcoin discount\nGrayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)—a financial vehicle that lets investors gain exposure to Bitcoin without needing to buy and hold the asset—has seen dismal performance as well, with the discount from the underlying Bitcoin value reaching almost 50% by the end of December.\nGrayscale’s attempts to convert GBTC into a Bitcoin ETF, which the firm believes “is the best long-term product structure for GBTC and its shareholders,” have been blocked by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the firm even suing the regulator over its refusal to greenlight the move.\nThe ongoing crisis has also put crypto broker Genesis on liquidity watch, with many eyes now focusing on Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, which owns both Grayscale and Genesis.\nNew York passes moratorium on Bitcoin mining\nOn November 23, New York Governor Kathy Hochul signed a controversial two-year moratorium on new permits for proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining operators that rely on carbon-based fuel to power their activities.\n“The law will prohibit Environmental Conservation Law permits from being issued for two years to proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining operations that are operated through electric generating facilities that use a carbon-based fuel,” reads a memo for the bill.\nApproved by the New York State Assembly in April, Senate Bill S6486D was passed by the New York State Senate in June this year.\nThe new legislation would still allow the issuance of permits for electric energy facilities that use alternatives to carbon-based fuel, such as hydropower.\nAD\nAD\nThe measure has been fiercely criticized by the crypto industry since it was first proposed in May 2021. It also earned ire of business groups concerned that the new legislation would curb the industry’s growth in the Empire State.\nThe proof-of-work mechanism underpins Bitcoin (BTC) and several other popular cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin (DOGE), Litecoin (LTC), Zcash (ZEC), Monero (XMR), and Ethereum Classic (ETC).\nEthereum (ETH), the industry’s second-largest cryptocurrency, used proof of work until its transition earlier this year.\nTether eliminates commercial paper from reserves\nTether, the issuer of USDT, has been repeatedly criticized for either failing to provide adequate attestations for the reserves backing the stablecoin or for failing to have such attestations executed by a Big Four accounting firm.\nThe company moved to help address that concern on October 13, announcing it had completely eliminated commercial paper from its reserves, replacing those investments with U.S. Treasury Bills.\nCommercial paper is unsecured, short-term debt issued by a corporation. Tether had previously said it would reduce its commercial paper holdings and has gradually done so this year.\nEarlier, rumors circulated that a portion of Tether’s commercial paper portfolio was “85% backed by Chinese or Asian commercial papers and being traded at a 30% discount.”\nBut Tether denied this, claiming the rumors were fabricated to “induce further panic in order to generate additional profits from an already stressed market.”\nPreviously, Tether claimed all its tokens were backed one-to-one by dollars stored in a bank. However, after a $18.5 million settlement with the New York attorney general, the company revealed it relied on a range of other assets, including commercial paper, to support its token.\nUK includes crypto in new reform package\nOn December 9, the UK government announced a package of more than 30 reforms to financial regulations, including the extension of tax breaks for investment managers to cover crypto assets.\nAD\nAD\nDubbed the “Edinburgh Reforms,” the measures are designed to replace EU regulation covering areas such as disclosure for financial products and include easing capital rules for smaller banks.\nMore specifically, the measures will facilitate the inclusion of crypto in the portfolios of overseas funds managed in Great Britain without creating a risk of UK taxation, with the changes expected to be implemented thorough HM Revenue & Customs regulations before the end of the year.\nThe UK government is also planning to bring forward a consultation on the case for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), with the Bank of England releasing a paper that will set out technology considerations informing the potential build of a digital pound.\nEU passes landmark crypto bill\nThe beginning of October saw European Union lawmakers sign off on the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)—the landmark legislation aimed at regulating the digital asset space within the union.\nThe regulation, in its current form, will require anyone seeking to issue cryptocurrencies to publish a “crypto-asset white paper” containing information about their project.\nIt also asks stablecoin companies to meet capital requirements: entities will be restricted on how many tokens they can issue if they are not denominated in euros or other currencies used by EU member states.\nOn top of that, the MiCA looks to regulate crypto mining, asking big “crypto-assets service providers” to disclose their energy consumption.\nThe legal text is now in the European Parliament, where, subject to approval, it will likely be published in the Official Journal of the European Union early next year, with the rules set to come into force in 2024.\nFTX goes down in flames\nThe sudden collapse of FTX, once a top-five exchange, along with the rest of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, sent waves of shock across the industry, with consequences likely to be felt for months, if not years.\nThe devastating effect of the FTX meltdown not only crashed the markets, sending the price of Bitcoin below $17,000 as of December 21, it also resulted in still-ongoing crypto contagion.\nMore companies going bust, hefty job cuts, the community demanding exchanges to share their proof of reserves, and investors putting deals on hold—all that has been the talk of the town for the past two months, overshadowing any other developments in the industry, however significant they might have been.\nAs for SBF himself, after his arrest in the Bahamas, the disgraced FTX founder is now on American soil, facing criminal charges from the Department of Justice, as well as from the SEC and the CFTC."}, {"date": "2022-12-29 19:06:39", "entity": ["gbtc", "securities and exchange commission",

However, after a $18.5 million settlement with the New York attorney general, the company revealed it relied on a range of other assets, including commercial paper, to support its token.\nUK includes crypto in new reform package\nOn December 9, the UK government announced a package of more than 30 reforms to financial regulations, including the extension of tax breaks for investment managers to cover crypto assets.\nAD\nAD\nDubbed the “Edinburgh Reforms,” the measures are designed to replace EU regulation covering areas such as disclosure for financial products and include easing capital rules for smaller banks.\nMore specifically, the measures will facilitate the inclusion of crypto in the portfolios of overseas funds managed in Great Britain without creating a risk of UK taxation, with the changes expected to be implemented thorough HM Revenue & Customs regulations before the end of the year.\nThe UK government is also planning to bring forward a consultation on the case for a central bank digital currency (CBDC), with the Bank of England releasing a paper that will set out technology considerations informing the potential build of a digital pound.\nEU passes landmark crypto bill\nThe beginning of October saw European Union lawmakers sign off on the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)—the landmark legislation aimed at regulating the digital asset space within the union.\nThe regulation, in its current form, will require anyone seeking to issue cryptocurrencies to publish a “crypto-asset white paper” containing information about their project.\nIt also asks stablecoin companies to meet capital requirements: entities will be restricted on how many tokens they can issue if they are not denominated in euros or other currencies used by EU member states.\nOn top of that, the MiCA looks to regulate crypto mining, asking big “crypto-assets service providers” to disclose their energy consumption.\nThe legal text is now in the European Parliament, where, subject to approval, it will likely be published in the Official Journal of the European Union early next year, with the rules set to come into force in 2024.\nFTX goes down in flames\nThe sudden collapse of FTX, once a top-five exchange, along with the rest of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire, sent waves of shock across the industry, with consequences likely to be felt for months, if not years.\nThe devastating effect of the FTX meltdown not only crashed the markets, sending the price of Bitcoin below $17,000 as of December 21, it also resulted in still-ongoing crypto contagion.\nMore companies going bust, hefty job cuts, the community demanding exchanges to share their proof of reserves, and investors putting deals on hold—all that has been the talk of the town for the past two months, overshadowing any other developments in the industry, however significant they might have been.\nAs for SBF himself, after his arrest in the Bahamas, the disgraced FTX founder is now on American soil, facing criminal charges from the Department of Justice, as well as from the SEC and the CFTC."}, {"date": "2022-12-29 18:52:38", "entity": ["bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Stacks, an existing smart contract platform, wants to break through those limitations by introducing a new digital asset derived from bitcoin – sBTC (pegged at 1:1 with bitcoin) – that can be used to create smart contracts on Stacks, but can also be readily converted back to bitcoin (BTC)."}, {"date": "2022-12-29 18:36:51", "entity": ["web3"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "Given the pace at which the NFT market moves, it’s certain that new trends will emerge in 2023.

In the screenshots shared with his more than 340,000 followers, someone claimed to have had access to more than 100,000 API keys leaked from 3Commas, which he eventually shared with Zach.\nZach explained that he had gone on to verify the veracity of these claims by checking the API keys and multiple people in a group created for those who had their 3Commas API keys leaked had confirmed that their keys were in fact in the database that had been shared with Zach.\nIn a follow-up tweet, Zach posted a letter that the sender called a “Late Christmas Gift” in which they claim that there was not a breach. Rather the information had been sold to them by the staff of the 3Commas team.\nA more alarming revelation was the fact that this person or group of people claim to have even more API keys. Apparently, they plan to publicly release the complete database of over 100,000 API keys. Thankfully, they plan to remove any personal or identifying information from the database in a bid to protect people.\n2/ I won’t spread the db as some of the keys are potentially still active but here is what the account had to say about the leak in a post: Unfortunately it seems they will be publishing the full database of 3Commas users soon. pic.twitter.com/XSf6GslXZ8 — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) December 28, 2022\n3Commas Finally Acknowledges The Leak\nIn light of the exposure provided by the ZachXBT thread, the 3Commas team has taken responsibility for the data leak for the first time. Founder and CEO Yuriy Sorokin took to Twitter to acknowledge the authenticity of the claims. The CEO explained that they had been investigating an inside job but were unable to determine that the leak was from a staff member.\n1. Statement from 3Commas: We saw the hacker’s message and can confirm that the data in the files is true. As an immediate action, we have asked that Binance, Kucoin, and other supported exchanges revoke all the keys that were connected to 3Commas. — Yuriy Sorokin (@YS_3Commas) December 28, 2022\nInterestingly, Sorokin explains that the small number of technical employees who had access to the data had been stripped of their access on Nov. 19, which means they had known about the leak for at least a month. But 3Commas had continued to gaslight users, accusing them of falling for phishing scams and asking them to go to exchanges when the problem had come from them all along.\nTota market cap remains below $1 trillion | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com\n“3Commas finally acknowledged the leak but the damage had already been done. For weeks they have been blaming its users and accepting zero responsibility,” ZachXBT said. Make sure to never give incompetent clowns like @3commas_io your business ever again.”\nCustomers and exchanges have been advised to revoke all API keys connected to the 3Commas platform.

The asset has already lost a massive chunk of its all-time high value but the onslaught looks to be far from over. In the last seven days, the losses for the digital asset have ramped up, dragging its price down into single-digit territory.\nSolana Posts More Than 20% Losses\nAccording to crypto data aggregator Coinmarketcap, the price of Solana is down more than 20% in the last 7 days alone. These losses align with the general bear market trend being experienced in the crypto sector but the decline in faith in the digital asset brought about by the collapse of FTX, Solana’s biggest support, puts added pressure on it.\nSam Bankman-Fried, through FTX and Alameda Research, had funneled massive amounts of funds into the Solana ecosystem, which in hindsight reveals why the network had grown so much in such a short period of time. However, with all of that money gone, the network has had a hard time keeping up.\nAlso, as James Spediacci notes on Twitter, a lot of the dev activity on the network was actually faked. It alleges that SOL stablecoin exchange Saber and DeFi protocol Sunny had made up about 70% of the total value locked on the Solana blockchain at its peak were operated by the Macalinao brothers, citing a report from CoinDesk.\nWith all of these gone and no new money being injected into the ecosystem by Bankman-Fried, Solana is now in a freefall of its own making.

It is now sitting at its lowest point since February 2021, which was the last time that Solana had seen single-digit prices before the bull market took over.\nHowever, even with the digital asset dropping so low, it is unlikely that the decline is over. One thing to always note is how badly cryptocurrencies tend to perform in their first bear cycle, even bitcoin and ethereum weren’t exempted. But one thing that sets SOL apart is the factors surrounding its decline.\nWhile digital assets such as bitcoin and ethereum still had ample support and faith in the market even after dropping more than 90% in their first bear markets, Solana is having a hard time keeping the faith. Add in the fact that leading NFT projects DeGods and yOOts migrated from Solana to Ethereum and Polygon and it shows just how negative the sentiment surrounding the network is.\nNevertheless, this is not to say that SOL is completely out of the game. There are been more surprising recoveries in the crypto world and SOL remains popular in the media, albeit in negative circumstances. The next bull market could hold a lot of promise for the digital asset if it is able to survive the crypto winter.\nFeatured image from Crypto News, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-29 16:45:00", "entity": ["vulcan", "vulcan", "vulcan", "defi", "vulcan", "defi", "vulcan", "vulcan", "vulcan", "vulcan", "vulcan", "vulcan", "vulcan", "vulcan"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "December 28, 2022, Tallinn, Estonia: Vulcan Blockchain has just announced that its’ novel auto-rebasing Layer 1 protocol will launch in Q1 of 2023. The protocol, which has been under development for some time aims to balance supply side issues affecting market stability. In this vein, the primary key feature of the Vulcan Blockchain is its Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes.\nVulcan, named after the god of fire and forge, features unique never before seen blockchain technology. Auto-Rebasing is a unique feature that allows a blockchain to automatically adjust its supply of circulating coins. This can be an important tool for maintaining the stability and value of the native coin over time, as well as providing a more predictable and transparent monetary policy.\nThe Vulcan Blockchain is also Auto-Compounding, which means that as a holder of $VUL, your ownership of coins increases with each epoch.\n“In addition to providing stability, an Auto-Rebasing blockchain can also help to provide greater transparency and predictability,”\nsaid Jason Matthison, COO of Vulcan.\n“By clearly outlining the rules and conditions under which the supply of tokens will be adjusted, an auto-rebasing blockchain can give users and investors a better understanding of the monetary policy of the network. This can help to increase confidence in the network, making it more attractive to users and investors,” he added.\nTo add to its Auto-Rebasing, Auto-Compounding capabilities, the Vulcan Blockchain also has a unique burn mechanism, known as the \"Fire Pit” (a null address). 80% of all transaction fees on the network are automatically sent to the Fire Pit, which is totally inaccessible and burns the coins from the circulating supply forever. This feature allows $VUL to become hyper deflationary and a trusted store of value cryptocurrency over time.\nThe combination of these features, along with the commitment to decentralization, makes the Vulcan Blockchain the ideal platform for DeFi applications. Whether you are a user, developer, or investor, the invitation exists to join the Vulcan Network on this exciting journey and be a part of the future of DeFi.\nAbout Vulcan Blockchain\nVulcan Blockchain is the first blockchain with a built-in Auto-Rebasing mechanism, which adjusts the circulating supply of $VUL (the native coin) every 15 minutes.

However, contrary to the crypto tradition of predicting the most lucrative altcoins, Shapiro is making his predictions in terms of US crypto law.\nThe year 2022 was undoubtedly one of the most turbulent years for the crypto industry, which had to cope with the collapse of numerous fraudulent and overleveraged companies. The collapse of FTX and its entanglements in U.S. politics, at the latest, should give U.S. lawmakers ample reasons to regulate the crypto industry more tightly in the year ahead.\nIn this regard, Shapiro predicts that a money laundering issue will be uncovered on a national level related to cryptocurrencies. For example, “FTX could be revealed to be connected with Iran-Contra style arms smuggling to Ukraine.”\n(1) at least one major crypto project will register its existing token or smart contract system as a security with the SEC as part of a comprehensive pre-trial settlement — _gabrielShapir0 (@lex_node) December 28, 2022\nRegarding centralized exchanges, Shapiro suspects that a CEX bankruptcy will expose a major mistake by a prestigious law firm. Under regulatory pressure from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the lawyer says, “at least one major crypto project will register its existing token or smart contract system as a security with the SEC as part of a comprehensive pre-litigation settlement.”\nShapiro also predicts that one to three new crypto projects will seek registration with the SEC as securities. Moreover, legislative pressure may not stop at the DeFi sector. In terms of anti-money laundering and KYC guidelines, Shapiro says at least one project will bow to the pressure and introduce CEX-style customer verification.\nGiven the tremendous growth in popularity of stablecoins and the increasingly debated introduction of a central bank digital currency (CBDC), Shapiro’s sixth prediction should come as a surprise to few. The attorney believes that a “meaningless stablecoin law will be passed for stablecoins in custody,” leaving it up to the Treasury Department to shape the rules. This could “pave the way for Circle to receive permanent structural advantages,” Shapiro said.\nCrypto Law Predictions For DeFi, NFTs, And Ethereum\nShapiro also expects more regulatory pressure for DAOs, which could face a wave of lawsuits from the CFTC and SEC. The attorney also expects a lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which “could file a serious claim” against a DeFi team for “misrepresentations” about how it operates.\nThe DeFi space is also concerned with the next prediction:\nThe CFTC publishes direct or indirect guidance on DeFi that indicates fully overcollateralized MakerDAO style vaults will not be viewed as leveraged transactions, but that everything else in DeFi is covered by CFTC regs; most fancy DeFi applications block the U.S.\nFlying under the radar for another year, on the other hand, could be MEV, GameFi, bridges, L2s, and zk-proofs, according to Shapiro.\nMajor IP problems are expected by Delphi Labs’ legal counsel for existing NFT-PFP projects, which are “declining dramatically in value amidst numerous lawsuits and investigations; other uses for NFT with better legal engineering emerge.”\nU.S. regulators, meanwhile, could focus on Ethereum ecosystem infrastructure providers. “At least one major U.S.-based Ethereum ecosystem infrastructure provider will add KYC/AML or other previously unthinkable compliance features to the base layer,” Shapiro continued.\nICOs, Binance, USDT, And Coinbase\nThe lawyer’s penultimate prediction relates to ICOs, which could make a comeback under the MiCA framework in the EU. “[T]his combined with a higher-interest-rate environment will mark a new cycle where VCs are less powerful in crypto.”\nIn the end, Shapiro holds an optimistic prediction for Binance, Bitfinex, and Tether, which he says will enter lightweight regulatory arrangements outside the U.S. and gain a surprising degree of international legitimacy. In contrast, he predicts that Coinbase will merge with U.S. investment banks and become a “U.S.-favored juggernaut.”\nAt press time, the Coinbase (COIN) share price was trading at $32.53, down 90.5% from its all-time high.\nFeatured image from Kelly Sikkema / Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-29 14:30:00", "entity": ["skylex mainnet", "skylex", "skylex network", "skylex", "skylex", "skylex network", "skylex", "skylex", "network", "mainnet", "skylex", "slx", "skylex", "skylex", "skylex", "skylex", "skylex", "slx", "slx", "slx", "slx network", "slx nodes", "skylex", "skylex", "skylex network", "slx explorer", "slx", "skylex", "twitter", "linkedin", "telegram", "skylex", "skylex", "skylex", "skylex"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Skylex Layer-1 blockchain is preparing to launch its mainnet in Q3 of 2023. Once the mainnet is launched, Skylex will be able to reduce the block's finality to 3 seconds. To do that, Skylex Network has developed multiple products and services that allow users to join the world’s fastest-developing digital ecosystem.\nSkylex’ Goal for 2023 Mainnet Launch\nThe Layer-1 blockchain Skylex is preparing to launch its mainnet in Q3 of 2023, reducing the block's finality to 3 seconds. And in that process, Skylex Network has developed multiple products and services that allow users to join their digital ecosystem.\nThe project combines Layer-1 technology with products such as mobile crypto client-side wallets, decentralized and centralized exchanges, and the SLX nodes. This way, Skylex is developing a network of cooperating products and services to maximize users' and companies' bond with the crypto world, as well as strengthen the Skylex brand on the market. Such combinations ensure the incredibly high stability of the entire Skylex ecosystem.\nTechnology has allowed the world to unlock extensions of talent that previous generations could not even dream of. However, a couple of technology giants control electronic devices, vehicles, banking systems, and social media platforms that are now part of our daily lives. Monopolizing an unethical industry, companies interfere with users’ privacy. However, blockchain promises the most in protecting user privacy. The distributed nature and various forms of encryption on the blockchain allow users to interact securely through a fair and private system. Although the potential of blockchain is clear, the technology is in its infancy.\n“SKYLEX Network was created to return to society financial freedom, transparency of transactions, as well as the possibility of free choice. We’ve created a platform and an ecosystem from scratch, the main pillar of which is users’ freedom.” - says Skylex VP David Ternus.\nSLX Nodes\nEach SLX Node contains a specific number of SLX tokens and allows anyone to participate in confirming transactions on the SLX network, which ultimately translates into participation in the rewards from confirmed transactions. By acquiring SLX Nodes, each user joins the activity Skylex Network, which maximizes and stabilizes the performance and development of the Skylex Network ecosystem and gets rewarded for it. All transactions carried out on exchanges by Skylex Network are available in SLX Explorer. The total number of SLX Tokens in the nodes with limited available quantity equals 20,000,000,000 SLX tokens (i.e., 194,000 SLX Nodes).\nWith such a limited number of Nodes, the principle of \"First come, first served\" is holy, so joining the Skylex Network at an early stage will let everyone get their own validator. It is also worth noting that in the first week after the launch of Skylex Network, the platform registered over 2,500 users, which is constantly growing. Furthermore, users should acknowledge that the mainnet launch strictly depends on the total SLX in Nodes sales.\nAiming on Constant Improvement\nSKYLEX was built with many features to differentiate it from its competitors, but its greatest strength lies in the team behind it.\n“We will consistently demonstrate our ability to innovate, execute and grow rapidly. These qualities serve us well in helping us stay one step ahead of the competition. There is enormous untapped potential in the cryptocurrency market, and we are excited to achieve our success with SKYLEX. We’d be ecstatic for our investors and supporters - who are our Skylex Stars - to join us on this journey.’ - says David Ternus.\nAbout Skylex Network\nSKYLEX Network was created to return to society financial freedom, transparency of transactions, and the possibility of free choice.\nThe company focuses on providing innovative technology, along with services and products that are fully functional and complete, such as decentralized and centralized crypto exchanges and a fully developed layer-1 blockchain.\nContact\nMore information is available on the official Skylex website and their socials, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Telegram.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

However, there has been word around the blockchain that the platform’s API database has been compromised for a while now. Just last week, there was news of crypto funds worth $22 million being siphoned away through these compromised API keys. Back then, the platform’s CEO claimed that the loss in funds happened due to the poor decisions taken by some users who fell for phishing scams.

Sharing the performance of the stock of some of the world's biggest companies, Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent cross-market investor and Bitcoin (BTC) advocate, has showcased the resilience of the cryptocurrency over these shares.\nTaking to Twitter, he revealed that in the year-to-date period, Amazon (AMZN), the world's largest retailer, has seen its shares slump by 50%. The electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) is down 69%, while payment giant Paypal (PYPL) is down by the same number. To Scaramucci, the 64% drop in Bitcoin, despite a tumultuous year characterized by the collapse of FTX, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), Terra (LUNA) and Genesis, among others, makes BTC a relatively better investment.\n\"I think we have a rough 6 months ahead - yet BTC (and, for that matter, ETH) resilience in face of terrible macro market for risk assets and historic idiosyncratic crypto disasters is impressive,\" he said in his tweet.\nConsidered one of the major figures in both the crypto and stock markets, Anthony Scaramucci's assessment of Bitcoin was made despite his firm, Skybridge Capital, being one of the top financiers of the now-bankrupt FTX Derivatives Exchange.\nBuilding resilience with tech\nAs one of the world's most valuable assets, Bitcoin is typically sustained by the tech it brandishes, which makes its operations highly decentralized.

According to a September 2022 study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, fossil fuels account for almost two-thirds (62.4%) of Bitcoin miners’ electricity mix.\nBetween 2020 and 2021, Bitcoin’s average emission intensity increased from (491.24 gCO2e/kWh) to (531.81 gCO2e/kWh), suggesting that the sustainability of the electricity mix has “deteriorated,” according to the study’s authors.\nBitcoin’s energy consumption and environmental impact has resulted in a global pushback from countries and companies. In May 2021, EV firm Tesla abandoned plans to accept payment for its products in Bitcoin, with CEO Elon Musk highlighting his concern over the “rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining.” The following month, China cracked down on Bitcoin mining, citing its commitment to \"carbon neutrality\" at the United Nations General Assembly in 2020.\nThat’s served to drive awareness and take-up of sustainable Bitcoin mining, with some advocates arguing that Bitcoin could actually help to accelerate the transition to renewables.\nCrunch time\nWith the crypto market facing a prolonged slump, Bitcoin miners are feeling the squeeze in their profit margins as Bitcoin mining difficulty has soared and the cryptocurrency’s price has plummeted.\nThat’s left Bitcoin miners hunting for cost-effective options that offer a stable income stream; something that Pega Pool is seeking to address with reduced pool fees for miners.\nClients that join Pega Pool’s early access waiting list will receive a permanent 50% reduction in pool fees, while clients that are accepted for beta testing will see 0% pool fees during the beta stage and a permanent pool fee of 0.5% post-launch.

In a recent Twitter Spaces event, the company's executive chairman, Michael Saylor, discussed their plans to not only hold and purchase BTC, but also to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem through their software offerings.\nAs MicroStrategy expands into the world of Bitcoin, it will use its existing expertise to provide businesses with tools for the Bitcoin and Lightning network.\nHow does the Lightning Network work?\nThe Lightning Network is a way to make payments using Bitcoin without having to record each transaction on the blockchain. When two users want to open a payment channel, they put a certain amount of Bitcoin into a smart contract on the blockchain.\nThey can then make as many transactions as they want within the channel. When they want to close the channel, they can either finalise the balance and record it on the blockchain, or they can agree on a new balance and keep the channel open.\nThe Lightning Network is helpful for small, frequent transactions because it allows users to avoid high fees and long confirmation times. It also helps to increase the capacity and scalability of the Bitcoin network.\nPlans for the Lightning Network\nMicroStrategy is looking at using the Lightning Network for a variety of purposes, including monetizing online content, enterprise marketing, setting up paywalls on websites, and internal corporate controls.\nMichael Saylor believes that chief marketing officers should be able to offer small amounts of Bitcoin, known as satoshis, as incentives for customers to leave reviews or provide feedback. He said:\n\"We want to make it possible for any enterprise to spin up Lighting infrastructure in an afternoon and onboard thousands of employees or customers. We want to plug it into enterprise technology and make it a marketing strategy for any forward thinking CMO.\"\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The warnings were issued on the Consumer Alert page on December 27 and 28.\nThe DFPI stated:\nThe DFPI urges consumers to exercise extreme caution before responding to any solicitation offering investment or financial services. To check whether an investment or financial service provider is licensed in California\nDFPI had last conveyed notifications regarding crypto frauds to caution consumers in June 2022.

Reportedly, consumers had lost about $2,000 to $1.2 million in fraud cases.\nThe two most common scams include ‘pig-slaughtering scams’ and ‘Advance Fee Scheme scams’.

The fraudster typically invests a lot of time in building these fake relationships and then gradually moves to conversations about investment opportunities, which are usually characterized as ‘too good to be true’.\nThe motive behind conducting such a scam is to ensure that the victim finally invests in a copycat website of a legitimate website, or by sending funds to a dubious wallet address. Along with the ‘pig-slaughtering scam’ is another scam called the ‘Advance Fee Scheme’.\nThis tactic involves the bad actors requesting a large sum of money, which are fake withdrawals from the scam websites.\nWhen the victim decides to act upon it, the fraudsters immediately get hold of the initial investment along with the recent transaction and then cut off all contact at that very instant."}, {"date": "2022-12-29 13:01:17", "entity": ["openbook", "raydium", "solana", "decentralized finance", "solana defi", "solana ecosystem", "coingecko", "serum", "solana", "decentralized exchange", "raydium", "ftx", "serum fork", "solana ftx", "solana", "sol", "solana", "slnd", "protocol solend", "bitcoin", "btc", "ethereum"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Positive"], "content": "Solana (SOL), the token powering the eponymous blockchain network, is down another 6% on Thursday morning, currently trading at $9.45, per CoinGecko.\nOnce highly praised by the disgraced founder of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX Sam Bankman-Fried, Solana fell below $10 for the first time in nearly two years on yesterday.

According to the nobleman, the nation plans to adopt BTC as a legal tender by the second quarter of 2023 and Bitcoin mining by the third quarter of 2023.\nThe island state has 21 active volcanoes that could meet the population’s electricity needs many times over, offering huge potential for mining with volcanic energy. Fiji, which consists of 330 islands and has a population of 903,000, is aiming to generate all of the islands’ energy from renewable sources by 2030 as part of a 20-year plan.\nGenerating electricity from volcanic energy, fueled by Bitcoin mining, could be an important lever for this. Moreover, the island nation has massive hydropower, unlike Tonga, as Lord Fusitu’a explained.\nIn addition to mining, Bitcoin and the Lightning Network could generate significant savings potential, as Fiji receives over 11% of its GDP from foreign remittances, according to the World Bank.\nHowever, when Fiji’s Rabuka addressed the nation for the first time as the new prime minister on Thursday, he did not yet mention Bitcoin. It, therefore, remains to be seen how the story will unfold.\nAt press time, the BTC price stood at $16,600.\nFeatured image from Janis Rozenfelds / Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-29 12:25:00", "entity": ["mba mortgage", "mortgage bankers association", "mango markets mango markets", "btc", "oscillator", "ethereum", "oscillator", "ultimate oscillator", "bitcoin", "argo", "bitcoin", "argo blockchain", "galaxy digital", "kraken", "kraken", "energy information administration", "eia", "eia"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "In Todays Headline TV CryptoDaily News:\nBitcoin miner Argo will avoid bankruptcy.\nBitcoin miner Argo Blockchain will avoid filing for bankruptcy protection, after it agreed to sell its Helios mining facility in Dickens Country, Texas, to Galaxy Digital for $65 million.

According to him, a major issue is that the SEC is seeking disgorgement against a nonparty entity, which has huge implications and could set a very bad precedent.\nSecond, Deaton highlights the SEC's proposed language for the permanent injunction. He says this proposed language could theoretically allow the SEC to reach into the secondary market and disallow transactions from individuals who are only users of the platform and have never acquired LBC for investment reasons.\nThird, the SEC is inappropriately seeking punitive disgorgement in a nonfraud case. The LBRY lawsuit, just like Ripple's, is a nonfraud case, but a Section 5 violation, which was the failure to register LBC sales.\nDeaton recalled that when the SEC won in the KIK case, it did not seek such disgorgement. He suggests that the SEC's action was punitive, as the agency claimed that all LBC token sales were profits.\nDeaton adds that the language of the proposed permanent injunction, coupled with the SEC's absolute refusal to distinguish secondary market sales or even transactions by users, demonstrates the SEC's intent to expand its jurisdictional reach into the secondary market.\nAs reported by U.Today, the SEC requested a penalty equal to LBRY's full pecuniary gain of $22,151,971, stating that LBRY's gross receipts for its Section 5 violation amounted to the sum it received in return for its sale of 280 million LBC on trading platforms."}, {"date": "2022-12-29 10:39:18", "entity": ["kaspersky", "south korean intelligence services", "bluenoroff", "cybersecurity ventures", "yahoo sports", "bluenoroff", "lazarus group", "kaspersky", "bluenoroff", "kaspersky", "bluenoroff", "kaspersky", "lazarus group", "axie infinity", "tradingview. com", "ftx", "world economic forum", "microsoft", "assaults"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "North Korean hackers are taking it a notch higher by pretending to be venture capitalists to steal from cryptocurrency startups.\nBlueNoroff, the name given by cybersecurity experts to a crew associated with the North Korean government-funded hacking operation Lazarus Group, has expanded its target list to include venture capital firms, cryptocurrency startups, and banks, a report by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab disclosed.\nBlueNoroff stole millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies by building more than 70 phony domains and mimicking financial firms and venture capital businesses, as revealed by Kaspersky on Tuesday.\nBlueNoroff is experimenting with new file types and delivery techniques for its virus, according to Kaspersky’s report.

Meanwhile, frustration with the SEC and lawmakers is growing in the U.S. crypto industry.\nDespite the fact that various industry leaders have called for clear laws and guidance for regulated progress, the agency led by Gary Gensler refuses to act. Instead, Gensler has repeatedly emphasized recently that the present regulatory framework is sufficient, and that the SEC will continue to rely on its regulatory approach through enforcement.\nAs Layton denounces, this is a policy driven by political interests. “Regulators sometimes use headline grabbing to send political messages to demonstrate their value to stakeholders,” Layton wrote.\nAs Sandra Hanna, head of Miller & Chevalier’s Securities Enforcement Practice, says, key crypto industry players have asked for guidance and tangible regulation, but this has not been forthcoming. She explains:\nThe well-established crypto participants are, in good faith, trying to engage with the staff. For reasons none of us understand, that process is too slow and cumbersome and has yet to bear fruit.\nRipple And LBRY Are On The Front Lines In The Battle Against The SEC\nRegarding Ripple’s legal case with the SEC, Layton notes that the regulator is living in its own “microcosm” with its sweeping argument that all crypto assets are securities. The SEC argues that all sales of XRP are investment contracts from the start, even if they took place on the secondary market.\n“The SEC’s arguments were so weak that Ripple’s attorneys rapidly turned the tables on the regulator in court and put the SEC itself on trial,” Layton continues, warning that all crypto companies – legal or fraudulent – are being undermined.\nAccording to Layton, the Ripple case will “likely” expose the SEC’s strategy of regulation through enforcement as “a flimsy attempt to expand its turf” while pretending to be concerned about investor protection.\nBut not only Ripple but also LBRY’s case against the SEC is increasingly coming into the spotlight of the crypto industry. As Bitcoinist reported, the SEC is demanding remedies from LBRY. Moreover, with the case, the SEC apparently wants to expand its jurisdiction to the secondary market of cryptocurrencies, which would be devastating for the entire crypto industry.\nTherefore, as attorney John E. Deaton writes, who also represents 75,000 XRP investors in the Ripple case, the January 30 hearing on LBRY’s request to limit the SEC’s remedies could become “arguably the most important hearing to date” for the crypto space.\nAlso, the SEC’s request for disgorgement from a non-party is far worse than a mere cease-and-desist order against LBRY. The action could theoretically allow the SEC to intervene in the secondary market and prevent transactions by people who are only users of a platform.\nAccording to Deaton, the SEC is inappropriately seeking punitive disgorgement in a non-fraud case. As in the Ripple case, SEC lawyers are also lacking “faithful allegiance to the law” and ignore applicable law, seeking compensation against an uninvolved entity that could set a very bad precedent.\n“[T]he language of the proposed permanent injunction, coupled with the SEC’s absolute refusal to distinguish secondary market sales or even transactions by users, demonstrates the SEC’s intent to expand its jurisdictional reach into the secondary market,” Deaton concluded.\nThe entire crypto industry should therefore hope for Ripple and LBRY to prevail in their battles against the SEC.\nAt press time, the XRP price stood at $0.3474.\nFeatured image from Sergeitokmakov | Pixabay, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-29 09:29:14", "entity": ["mango markets", "mango markets", "mango perpetual", "mango markets", "eisenberg", "eisenberg", "eisenberg", "defi", "mango markets", "eisenberg", "twitter", "eisenberg", "defi"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "A crypto trader who exploited code on the Mango Markets DeFi platform maintains that he only did what the code allowed him to do, and that “code is law”.\nArrested and accused\nCryptocurrency trader Avraham Eisenberg has been arrested in Puerto Rico and charged with fraud by the US Attorney's Office in Manhattan in connection with his alleged exploitation of decentralised finance platform Mango Markets in October.\nThe trader is accused of using two accounts he controlled to manipulate the price of Mango perpetual swaps, which are futures that allow traders to keep their positions open, and then using the swaps to borrow and withdraw approximately $100 million worth of various tokens from the deposits of other investors on Mango Markets.\nA legal trading strategy?\nDespite the largely unregulated nature of DeFi, Eisenberg is facing legal consequences for his alleged fraudulent activities, which he had previously boasted about on social media as a \"highly profitable\" and legal trading strategy.\nEisenberg had been openly discussing his activities on Twitter with over 40,000 followers, claiming that he was pushing the DeFi industry to improve its risk controls.\nHowever, many of the strategies Eisenberg used, such as generating trades to artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency and then borrowing against the artificially higher-valued asset, are considered manipulation in traditional markets and are illegal.\nCode is law?\nDespite this, the decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) that runs Mango Markets agreed to allow Eisenberg to keep almost half of the over $100 million in assets he obtained in exchange for releasing the rest of the funds. Eisenberg remained convinced that he had done nothing wrong.\nEisenberg's claims of innocence may be rooted in the \"code is law\" philosophy of DeFi, which holds that the ultimate authority in cryptocurrency is the underlying computer code of most projects. According to this belief, if the code permits a trade to be executed, it is considered legally binding within the world of cryptocurrency. This theory is often cited by proponents of DeFi as a justification for their actions.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

We recently caught up with GoldFever’s CEO Emilian Ciocanea to learn more about the game. In the interview, Emilian explains their vision and the journey so far.\nNewsBTC: Hi Emilian, let us begin by introducing you to our readers. Can you please tell us more about the journey that led you to GoldFever?\nEmilian: First of all, a warm hello to your readers – we are really glad we can bring the Gold Fever story to your audiences. I have been a business builder, an entrepreneur, with Product & Business Management for over 20 years now; and a blockchain investor since the very beginning of this industry.\nI am from those who have seen Ethereum valuing 5 USD. The conviction that the world can be improved and seeing the reality from different angles helped me tap into different emergent industries – at that moment – with the purpose to take the innovative side and create valid business models that would generate value and change perceptions.\nGold Fever started off in 2020, amidst the Covid lockdown. It was a bootstrap project in the beginning, like most of the projects I started, building up on the idea reiterated by CZ Changpeng Zhao, head of Binance, saying, back in 2019, that “Gaming will be an early adopter of blockchain technologies.” Inspired by the Gold Rush and how gold digging impacts the economy of a region, I developed the MVP using my own resources and pitched it to investors along with the idea that an MMORPG on the blockchain would bring in the best of the two worlds, would remain a fun game, but also a relevant platform for savvy traders.\nTwo years later, I look at the genesys moment with a wiser and grateful eye – the complexity of an MMORPG in terms of gameplay influenced the way we envisioned the game economy and the way we approached the go-to-market: first, allow settlers to buy the game assets and allow them to learn the economy, then invite passionate players. Of course, everyone is welcome at any time. In between, there were a lot of hurdles given to the complexity of the game and the complexity of our smart contracts.\nWe opened our kitchen for our early adopters so that they know the exact status of the development, we have a team of loyal players that have been with us from day 1 and helped with constant feedback and playing, we are now in beta and planning to launch end of Q2/Q3 2023 the mainnet website version.\nNewsBTC: Tell us more about GoldFever. How is it different from other P2E games?\nEmilian: GoldFever is different from several points of view.\nGameplay based on realism and on skills, with a free-to-play\nThe gameplay is based on realism and it mimics real life, which opens the gate for a more refined and maybe mature approach. The graphics are beautiful – it’s a dark-themed game built on Unreal 5.1, with action happening in the rainforest. Some parts are so real you can’t tell what is what.\nCommercial NFTs – created thanks to Ownership and decentralization.\nWe decided to go that extra mile that was on everyone’s lips. Rethinking ownership and actually doing it on blockchain allowed us to go beyond the P2E model, a revolution in itself.\nWe decentralized the game – really decentralized – took the main game assets and changed their ownership. Give them to the players. Lands, buildings, transportation, shops or any type of commercial buildings. We turned these vital assets for the game into NFTs. Soon, we realized they will produce yield only if players would interact socially. So, considering the importance of social interaction for the economy, we created Commercial NFTs – as they are digital assets that can produce in-game yield.\nThe purpose of the decentralized ownership system is to generate a stable in-game economy and rely on a balance between “makers” and “takers” to keep things flowing. Such an economy needs a roughly equal mix of players who invest time and effort into generating assets to sell and players who want to spend real money to buy the product of that work as a shortcut to in-game success or status.\nThe term we coined for Gold Fever is the Game-Yield-Generator model.\nSo, in this challenging Gold Rush, you can not only grind for gold and earn, stake, lend or lease items, but also – and this is the Commercial NFT, the novel part – you would interact with each other to develop and trade the items you need within the game. You can work smart as an entrepreneur: either employ people that will help you increase your revenues or just set some fixed prices and let your NFTs, like buildings or planes, produce.\nTherefore, Gold Fever opted-in for decentralization – selling the Commercial NFTs to players, meaning all game assets and infrastructure – will stabilize the economy and create the base for the “makers”. The next step, being to “invite” the “takers” – the passionate players to actually play an attractive and juicy game, with a stable infrastructure.\nReally cool graphics\nI believe we are among the few – if not the only, MMORPG PvP survival blockchain game based on realism. And you can tell just by looking at it, it has cool graphics.\nNewsBTC: Please provide an insight into the GoldFever tokenomics and in-game economy.\nEmilian: If there is one single thing you should know about the in-game economy is the fact that Gold Fever is evolving the play2earn economy. How? By giving full ownership to the players – vital in-game assets like boats, planes, merchant shops, buildings, lands, mining claims, blueprints – are turned into NFTs.\nWe will sell them to our community or to any savvy trader as they are very important for the game to actually happen, but, the more popular the game becomes, the more valuable the NFTs become – for the players, for the crypto traders, for the free market.\nAnother important detail is the fact that we created new use cases for the NFT technology.\nThe investment logic behind this is quite obvious if you are a gamer, less likely to be grasped if you are a crypto investor.\nYou see, gamers are well aware of how much money they spend in-game to buy the skins, the weapons, the transportation or the food their character needs to survive. At a certain moment, they all considered how it would feel if they received a share of that money.\nSurvival games are supposed to allow players to survive inside the game without having to spend money, right? If you want to eat Coconuts all day long, we won't stop you, but don't expect your characters to be strong in battle. Eat a good breakfast from the Bar! pic.twitter.com/yg63PtF1qu — Gold Fever (@GoldFeverGame) December 2, 2022\nAll we did was to turn the assets that, in-game, produce this sort of items into NFTs.\nBasically, when you buy it, it brings along several “perks” thanks to the ownership – you own it, you set the prices for the items it produces, you put it to work by investigating the in-game offer-demand.\nSo, apart from the default set-up and the NFT – very much similar to yield farming – you have the possibility, if you choose to get involved and put in some effort, to multiply the basic revenue this NFT can produce you.\nA small example of how this works. Do you know the stores from Diablo Immortal? You went there and bought things because you needed them to play better. The money went to the game developers. Well, in Gold Fever, the item store is an NFT you can own and turn into a profitable business.\nIt produces a fixed number of items and services daily that could be increased by hiring other players to do tasks such as bringing wood, hunting, transportation from building to building, or special quests.\nYOU, as a business owner, YOU set the price and you decide what service your building offers, you decide the prices or the items your building is selling.\nAn example: you decide the price, but for the sake of simplicity let’s consider 1 USD price per item/service.\nSay…you sell 5 different items per day at 1USD/item with a minimal stock of 5 pieces from each and 30 people need your services – parking, hotel sleeping, sharpening, repairing etc and you charge 1USD/service.\nThis means an income of:\n25USD/day – 750USD/month from items;\n30USD/day – 900USD/month if one person needs only one service\n55USD/day – 1650USD/month in total\nNewsBTC: Walk us through the gameplay\nEmilian: Gold Fever is a free-to-play multiplayer strategy game. It hosts an enormous playable area that is covered by dense and dangerous jungles, tall mountains and, rivers filled with gold.\nThe action takes place in a generic Oceania island, at the beginning of the 20th century, around 1930. The world is still reeling from its previous global conflict. Maps have been redrawn, riches have been reallocated and colonies have changed hands. And after all of that, there is still so much to explore.\nFar across the oceans, there is an island that hides a dangerous secret. Rumors speak of an untapped source of gold and precious minerals. This has lured various brave Adventurers to the Island to try their luck at seizing fame and fortune. As if battling hunger, fatigue, the elements, and the hostile fauna of the Island wasn’t enough, the Tribal natives relentlessly defend their homes and holy golden remnants of their ancestral gods.\nThe danger is ever-present on the island whether battling human enemies or being hunted by predators. Surrounded by the never-ending ocean, no one can escape the siren call of the Gold Fever. Players can craft tools for survival and combat, forage for plants and herbs, and compete with other players for dominance in the search for gold.\nYou can play the game as an adventurer seeking gold or as a tribal defending the native gold. Being a survival game, the confrontation is thrilling, dangerous, and full of surprises, but it leads to a most-wanted reward – the golden nuggets in the form of an in-game currency called NGL.\nNewsBTC: What are the different monetization opportunities available for a regular user within the GoldFever ecosystem?\nEmilian: Gold Fever has several angles when it comes to monetization.\nSince it is built on a P2E economy, you can make money from the P2E strategies such as grind for gold, speculate NGL, flip our NFTs, participate in quests and tasks coming from the people who own the in-game assets and are developing the in-game economy.\nAnother monetization opportunity comes from owning NFTs, of course. We called the Commercial NFTs – meaning, as I described above, that, if you own such an NFT and you get involved in the game economy by following closely the offer-demand ratio, you can become a very wealthy business owner. Otherwise, the Commercial NFTs can provide you with a basic income based on the default items they produce and are sold depending on the number of players.\nAnother monetization opportunity is trading via our exchange – you can stake-burn, buy-sell, borrow-lend, offer collateral. Renting NFTs out for a limited period of time to other players or employing the NFTs to perform specific automated tasks for an appropriate fee is another way to earn money in Gold Fever.\nA fourth monetization opportunity is our affiliate program – which has a unique trait – you get to win constantly from all the purchase actions the person you bring in is making – you win from onboarding a new user, from the NFTs that user is buying acquisition, from the in-game taxes that user is generating or from all the taxes generated by that user when using the website exchange.\nNewsBTC: Would you like to share some information about your team at GoldFever?\nEmilian: Currently the team has 55 experts, it’s an international team, with a gaming background, as follows:\n11 Game Developers Unreal Engine C+++\n6 Backend & Blockchain Developers\n14 Artists 3D & Concept Artwork\n4 Technical Artists\n3 Environmental Artists\n1 Animator\n4 Sound Designers\n5 Game Designers\n5 Marketing Specialists\nNewsBTC: The P2E gaming segment is gradually becoming a heavily contested space, with lots of new projects entering the market. How do you intend to keep up or overtake your competition?\nEmilian: I’m happy to say that, from what I’ve seen, there is actually no competition in our niche. There is no Survival-RPG realistic PVP video game out there and I’m afraid they won’t come anytime soon. There are other games out there, some interesting, some pure crap, but there are enough players for everyone.\nThe truth is that we are looking forward to some competition that could actually help us learn something, but until serious studios decide to adventure in this realm, we will have no competition. Making an MMO takes 3-5 years and millions of dollars and that’s if you have experience. Doing a crypto MMO will take even more.\nPersonally, I like what Star Atlas is trying to do because I like Eve Online and Star Citizen, but also because we, as a studio, are planning to add two more games connected to Gold Fever. One would be a contemporary GTA-like game and one would be a Space Conquering game. Your character would start in Gold Fever and your great-grandchildren will inherit your genes and wealth in these 2 games\nNewsBTC: We are curious to know about GoldFever’s investors, partnerships and collaborations, if any. Would you like to shine some light on it?\nEmilian: Of course. Gold Fever was vetted early on by the DAO Maker which incubated us. I would add here Huobi, Matrix Capital and LD Capital, along with somewhere around 200 KOls and influencers which put their faith in us and became initial token holders.\nNewsBTC: How does one get started on GoldFever?\nEmilian: It’s very simple.\nRight now, if you have a mask NFT attached to your character.\nYou get the character for free, while onboarding.\nYou get the mask from OpenSea, mid-January.\nOtherwise, once we go to the mainnet, you will have to create an account on our website and you will instantly get the wallet and the free character and you can start playing the game.\nNewsBTC: What is in store for GoldFever, and the gaming community at large in the coming days?\nEmilian: As stages of development, after setting the game core loop – the gold grinding, we will start, from Q1 2023 the decentralization and sell all the NFT infrastructure to settlers/entrepreneurs willing to develop the economy.\nAround mid-January we are planning our first NFT sale – the Genesys Masks – which will be available on NFT marketplace OpenSea. It unlocks a premium beta of the game that will go live from the end of January up until the end of June.\nThe premium beta has installed for the players prizes up to 1 million USD in NGL and NFTs. Players won’t be able to access the mainnet until Q3 without a mask, a very special NFT that gives you super perks and bonuses."}, {"date": "2022-12-29 08:58:00", "entity": ["crypto. com", "nft", "ape yacht club", "decentralized finance", "defi"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

According to the report, the industry experienced a total of 125 hacks this year alone, and the top five protocols saw a total of $1.48 billion moved by hackers.\nThe Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem accounted for the most attacked offshoot in the industry.

Expert developers in the industry have continued to express dissatisfaction about how much the protocols — particularly bridges — attract hackers.\nIn its account, Forbes recounted that the five largest hacks of the year include the $625 million Ronin Network hack, the $325 WormHole Network exploit, the $190 million Nomad Bridge, the $182 million Beanstalk Farms breach and the $160 million Wintermute hack.\nHacks beyond DeFi\nWhile DeFi saw the most hacks, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and crypto exchanges also recorded a number of exploits all year long. One of the first victims of an exchange hack was Crypto.com, which lost as much as $35 million in mid-January.

The collapse of FTX, one of the most prominent cryptocurrency exchanges in the space, sent shockwaves through the industry and is touted as the worst collapse in recent financial history.\nThe Case Against Bankman-Fried\nAccording to court records, Bankman-Fried is expected to be arraigned on the 3rd of January 2023 before US District Judge Lewis Kaplan at the Manhattan Federal Court. Kaplan was assigned to the case after the original judge had to recuse herself due to a conflict of interest. This was because her husband’s law firm had advised FTX before it collapsed. Bankman-Fried faces a long list of charges brought in by prosecutors, who accused him of engaging in a years-long “fraud of epic proportions.”\nBankman-Fried is accused of using customer deposits, which he redirected to the crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, to purchase real estate and make political donations. He is charged with two counts of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy, including laundering money and committing campaign finance violations. If Bankman-Fried is convicted, he could spend decades behind bars.\nBankman-Fried has been a significant political donor, with reports claiming that the FTX founder donated millions to both major political parties in the United States, the Democrats, and the Republicans. It is speculated that these donations were made most likely to protect himself in case the operations did not go to plan. According to the data available, the Democrats had received over $40 million from FTX and representatives of the exchange, while Republicans received over $23 million from the exchange.\nCaroline Ellison, Gary Wang To Cooperate With Authorities\nMeanwhile, two associates of Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda Research, and Gary Wang, co-founder of FTX, had pleaded guilty to defrauding investors. Prosecutors revealed that both had agreed to cooperate with the authorities, which puts significant pressure on the former billionaire. Damian Williams, Manhattan US Attorney, urged others associated with the fraud to come forward, stating,\n“If you participated in misconduct at FTX or Alameda, now is the time to get ahead of it,” Williams said. “We are moving quickly, and our patience is not eternal. I also said that last week’s announcement would not be our last, and let me be clear once again, neither is today’s.”\nWhile no comment was made from the attorneys of Caroline Ellison, a lawyer for Gary Wang stated,\n“Gary has accepted responsibility for his actions and takes seriously his obligations as a cooperating witness.”\nCould Bankman-Fried Get A Similar Deal?\nIt is speculated that SBF could get similar deals to Ellison and Wang, with both having already paid hefty fines. However, the authorities have yet to provide further details on their course of action regarding Bankman-Fried. Speaking about the case and the options before Bankman-Fried, Jay Clayton, former US Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman, stated,\n“All of these things will be the subject of negotiation if there is a plea arrangement. Like you said before, there is a ton of considerations that are going to go into this (political, legal, financial, etc.). I think there will be tremendous pressure to reach a resolution.”\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The market has experienced its worst-performing year for benchmark assets, such as Bitcoin, the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and others.\nExcept for Natural Gas, other assets saw their worst losses since the 1970s. Bitcoin (BTC) alone crashed over 70% from its all-time high, while Ethereum (ETH) saw a 72% loss. This negative performance “was a by-product of the sharpest rate hike cycle in recent history” by the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).\nCrypto Forecast: What You Need To Pay Attention To\nAccording to QCP Capital’s crypto forecast, the Fed will likely continue to pressure the markets. The financial institution is trying to bring down inflation from a 9% high to its target of about 2%. Thus, the Fed hikes interest rates and unwinds its balance sheet.\nWhile inflation probably peaked at those levels, QCP Capital believes the market will see “sticky” or persistent inflation. In order words, the financial institution will have difficulty lowering inflation to its target.\nThis scenario could worsen if commodities prices, such as oil prices, push back above $100. Per the trading desk’s report, this is not the first time the Fed would face a similar scenario.\nIn the 1970s, the financial institution hiked interest rates and brought down inflation, but the metric rebounded when oil prices trended to the upside. The war between Ukraine and Russia could have similar consequences to the 1970s and operate as fuel for inflation.\nAs a result, the upside potential for Bitcoin and risk-on assets might be capped as long as inflation remains “sticky.” Furthermore, QCP Capital believes the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is unaware of the dangers of an uptick in inflation.\nTherefore, the financial institution will embrace a crash in risk-on assets, such as crypto, and ignore investors’ pain. QCP Capital said the following on what could be one of the essential items for their crypto forecast:\nThis will lead them to accept a recession rather than risk a rebound in inflation, even if the inflation spike is again due to supply side shocks. In terms of recession probabilities, we are now above the 2020 Covid highs, and fast approaching 2008 GFC and 2001 Dot.com levels.\nCrypto’s Hope At The End Of The Tunnel\nThere is potential for an upside if the Fed rushes to ease its monetary policy. In the past months, some financial institution representatives hinted at this possibility.\nIf this faction succeeds, the global market might see a sharp rebound, including Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The U.S. Dollar, represented by the DXY Index, will continue to operate as a direct obstacle for digital assets.\nRegarding technical analysis, the DXY Index has seen some losses in the past six weeks but is likely to bounce off its current levels. This upside price action might take the dollar back to 120, punishing global currencies, equities, and risk on assets. A break below these levels might trigger an opposite scenario.\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at $16,600 with sideways movement on the daily chart.

On higher timeframes, the cryptocurrency records similar losses. Across the crypto market, red is the predominant color as significant assets follow BTC into the downside.\nBitcoin Price Bound For A Spike In Volatility\nThe decline in trading volume due to the holiday season has led the Bitcoin price to move sideways. This status quo is poised to change in early January when market participants return to active trading.\nHowever, the bulls might have issues pushing the price beyond local resistance at around $17,500 and $19,200, two levels that used to operate as critical support. Historically, the first month of the year is among the worst performers.\nSince 2013, the Bitcoin price has traded in the red for 60% of its monthly performance during January. According to a pseudonym analyst, this period has ended in adverse price action for the benchmark cryptocurrency.\nIn addition to negative performance, the Bitcoin price often experiences sudden changes in its value. During this month, the cryptocurrency sees a spike in volatility which historically favors the selling side. The analyst said while sharing the chart below:\nWe can also see how the percentage change on average in January is quite major. Both up and down. Will January bring some volatility back into the market? (…). Keep in mind that this data is not a reliable indicator for future returns. Use in confluence.\nAfter The Storm, Will Bitcoin Bounce?\nOn a positive note, February is one of Bitcoin’s best-performing assets. Last year, the Bitcoin price ascended from a new all-time high of around $30,000 to $60,000. As seen in the chart above, February brought double-digit gains for BTC since 2021.\nThus, while BTC might see a negative first month in 2023, February and March might become more favorable. This possible future performance coincides with some positive developments in the macroeconomic landscape, including a decrease in inflation and a short-term cap in interest rates hike from the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed).\nHowever, these conditions could apply for a limited time. NewsBTC reported that the traditional market would determine much of what happens with the Bitcoin price and the crypto market.\nIf equities can rebound from their current levels and kick off 2023 on a high note, the benchmark crypto might follow.

Noun owners can vote on proposals that tap into that treasury—which currently holds some $32.7 million worth of ETH—to fund projects that expand the project’s aim of building open-source IP.\nAs noted, the Nouns glasses appeared in a Super Bowl commercial from Bud Light, as well as on limited edition cans of the popular beer. Nouns will also appear in the indie film “Calladita,” and the DAO has funded projects ranging from physical Noggles to Web3 education initiatives to an appearance at New York Fashion Week.\n“The goal of Nouns is to proliferate the meme,” Stoopid Buddy Head of Development Chris Waters told Decrypt. “The Rose Parade is a cultural institution in America with a viewing audience over 30 million every year. As a volunteer-run event that focuses on fun, creativity, and community, it’s the perfect fit for Nouns, which shares those values and that culture.”\nConcept artwork of the Nouns-themed Rose Parade float. Image: Stoopid Buddy Stoodios\nIn this case, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios requested nearly 610 ETH to fund creation of the parade float, costumes, and film, which was approved by the DAO in June. The funding was valued at over $1.1 million as of June 1, when the proposal passed, although 610 ETH is only worth about $723,000 today due to the declining value of Ethereum.\nA DAO, or decentralized autonomous organization, is an online community with a shared goal or purpose, with membership typically represented through ownership of blockchain tokens. In this case, Nouns DAO membership is based on owning one of the NFTs, allowing holders one vote per NFT towards community proposals.\nStoopid Buddy announced today that its “Meet the Nouns” float and costumed characters are all set for next Monday’s parade, following the months-long process of pitching its plan to the DAO, gaining entry into the Rose Parade, and then bringing the project to life.\nAD\nAD\nRather than recreate specific existing Nouns NFT avatars, which are built from a randomized set of character attributes, Waters told Decrypt that the six costumes spotlight a variety of traits from the project. One even has a nod to “Robot Chicken,” its stop-motion animation hit.\n“We really wanted to show off the fun and positive side of Nouns and crypto,” explained Stoopid Buddy co-founder Eric Towner. “There were so many possibilities, but ultimately we landed on building the biggest and most ridiculous thing we could come up with: a 65-foot-long float covered in flowers, and [marching] it down the street in front of millions of people.”\nIn addition to its TV series, Stoopid Buddy Stoodios also creates the costumes for Fox’s competition series “The Masked Singer,” and created animation for Marvel’s recent “The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special.” Earlier this year, the studio released its own Stoopid Monkey NFTs via Nifty Gateway.\nGreen announced earlier this year that he was working on a TV series called “White Horse Tavern,” which features his owned Bored Ape Yacht Club avatar and other NFT characters interacting with human actors.

This was because Alameda Research, a sister company also founded by Bankman-Fried, had the ability to use FTX customer assets for its own means and without oversight, according to newly appointed FTX CEO John J.

During the visit, Dr. Ming Wu had an in-depth discussion with the heads and reception staff of various institutions under the new \"Policy Declaration on the Development of Hong Kong Virtual Assets\" officially released in October.\nOver the past several years, stringent COVID-19 travel control measures and regulatory uncertainty saw many Hong Kong blockchain and crypto companies shift their businesses to more hospitable areas. This policy shows a significant refocus on digital assets and coincides with the launch of the first two exchange-traded funds for cryptocurrency in Hong Kong.\nDr. Ming Wu introduced the Conflux Tree-Graph public chain, explaining it is the only compliant, public and permissionless chain in China and has achieved 3000+ TPS, 5000+ nodes and 0.5s block generation. In terms of throughput, confirmation time, and cost of use, it has 2-3 orders of magnitude advantages over the international first-generation public chain \"Bitcoin\" and the second-generation public chain \"Ethereum\". The system performance ranks first in the world.\nDr. Mig Wu said 'Hong Kong's open environment for crypto provides more opportunities for practitioners in Web3 and Metaverse, especially for those from China. People here have more freedom to make the technique and business innovations in a compliant manner. This will also accelerate the integration of Web3 into the traditional internet business and economies to maximally extract its value. By expanding to Hong Kong, Conflux will be able to take a whole different strategy and have the potential to become the foundation to fulfill the Web3 vision of Hong Kong.'\nThe expansion follows Conflux Network being named a potential unicorn, a private startup company valued at over $1 billion, in the Emerging Giants in Asia Pacific joint report from HSBC and KPMG. One of only five blockchain-related companies to make the prestigious list.\nAbout Conflux\nConflux is a permissionless Layer 1 blockchain connecting decentralized economies across borders and protocols. Recently migrated to hybrid PoW/PoS consensus, Conflux provides a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain environment with zero congestion, low fees, and improved network security.\nAs the only regulatory-compliant public blockchain in China, Conflux provides a unique advantage for projects building and expanding into Asia.

But amid the sometimes overwhelming glut of projects, only a handful stood out as being truly impactful and memorable for more than just headline-grabbing dollar values.\nWhich NFT projects were the most innovative, and which leveraged the technology in unique, out-of-the-box ways? Here are our picks for the standout projects of 2022.\nAD\nAD\nQQL\nExamples of QQL artwork turned into NFTs. Image: QQL.\nQQL is an Ethereum generative art NFT collection created by Tyler Hobbs and Dandelion Wist. Hobbs is best known as the creator behind the Art Blocks project Fidenza, which racked up numerous seven-figure (USD) sales in 2021, and his next move was eagerly anticipated. Sure enough, it sold $17 million worth of NFT mint passes upon launch despite the ongoing crypto bear market.\nAs with Fidenza, QQL artwork is generated using a finely-tuned algorithm deployed to the blockchain, in this case turning out mesmerizing waves of colorful circles large and small. But there's a twist: buyers of the mint pass get to shape the final artwork that they turn into an NFT. Anyone can play with the QQL algorithm and turn out potentially dazzling results, but only mint pass owners get to add an NFT to the official collection.\nThis engagement and interactivity with collectors established a new paradigm for NFT creation and ownership, gamifying the NFT minting process and giving holders the chance to become artists themselves. Also interesting: the person who generated the particular artwork seed (typically the NFT minter) gets a small share of royalties when the art is resold.\nProof of Merge\nAnnouncing Proof of Merge: a fully on-chain, non-transferable, and dynamic NFT that will change throughout The Merge:https://t.co/ZCCUqbZprq pic.twitter.com/k3A0BQPWiB — Michael Blau (@blauyourmind) September 12, 2022\nThe Ethereum merge was one of the most-anticipated crypto developments this year. As a side project, Andreessen Horowitz staffers Mason Hall and Michael Blau created “Proof of Merge” dynamic Ethereum NFTs to celebrate the event. Each NFT acts as a “proof of attendance” of sorts that proves the user who minted it participated in Web3 before the merge took place\nHall and Blau’s NFTs automatically changed their metadata via the collection’s smart contract—which holds the code that powers autonomous decentralized apps (dapps)—thus evolving the appearance of the NFT to match the state of the merge process in real time.\nEach NFT began as a static image of a separate black and white circle. When the merge began, the NFTs were updated to be partly-merged circles. Once complete, the NFTs updated again to their final stage: a Yin-Yang symbol that pays homage to an Ethereum panda bear meme, where the blockchain's execution layer (black bear) and consensus layer (white bear) combine to form the adorable mammal.\nNouns\nLaunched in 2021, the Nouns NFT project and corresponding DAO continued to build on their premise of community governance and open-source IP creation. The collection, which auctions off one pixelated Noun profile picture (PFP) NFT per day, has amassed a huge war chest of funds with 29,150 ETH in its treasury as of this writing—about $37.8 million worth.\nAD\nAD\nNoun holders vote on project proposals and have spent their pooled funds on a variety of different initiatives, such as promoting Nouns at crypto conferences, supporting Web3 education in Brazil, and bringing the Nouns to New York Fashion Week. Further efforts include charitable endeavors, physical collectibles, and even a professional esports team.\nEven mainstream brands are in the mix—Bud Light was granted a Noun early this year and used its boxy \"Noun glasses\" in a Super Bowl commercial, for instance. Nouns was also among the first notable NFT collections to use a Creative Commons CC0 license, meaning Nouns IP can be used by anyone to create and sell anything they'd like. The idea is that value ultimately still accrues back to the NFT holders.\nShibuya\nArtist Emily \"pplpleasr\" Yang has a new vision for the future of cinema—and she’s using NFTs to fund it. Shibuya aims to become the “A24 of Web3” by selling NFTs as voting chips of sorts, yielding a community that collectively decides how storylines develop while funding future projects in the process.\nIn December, Shibuya raised $6.9 million in seed funding, co-led by a16z and Variant Fund, to further its mission. Its first project is the anime series “White Rabbit,” which follows a young person exploring a mystical crypto world. Pplpleasr wants to help Web3 get some taste, telling Decrypt that “Content in Web3 right now is just bad. There’s a lot of money in Web3 to make content, but there’s not a lot of tastemakers.” Here’s to changing that!\nGoblintown\nArtwork from Goblintown. Image: Goblintown.\nWho loves moaning incoherently and (hopefully pretending to be) drinking piss? That’s right: a Goblintown NFT holder. These Ethereum NFTs went viral at the end of May when the crypto bear market began, shortly after the collapse of the Terra blockchain. As NFT-trading \"degens\" began to lose hope, they fell in love with NFTs that reveled in idiocy, fecal matter, and madness.\nThe Goblintown NFTs were a smash hit—and while the art was certainly ugly, the launch was clever and intentional. The NFTs were launched with “No roadmap. No Discord. No utility,\" per the project, and from a free mint came some $96 million worth of secondary market trading since. The irreverent humor brought much-needed levity to the struggling crypto community—and sparked one of 2022’s wildest NFT trends.\nReddit Collectible Avatars\nExamples of Reddit NFTs. Image: Reddit.\nFollowing a summer launch, Reddit’s NFTs—which it calls “collectible avatars”—exploded in popularity this fall. Some of the Polygon NFTs became highly-coveted and popular, as users across the online forum platform sported Snoos of varying colors and designs, which Reddit had airdropped to many for free.\nAs of now, over 7 million Reddit NFTs have been minted on Polygon, with more than 5.3 million unique holders in the mix. Holistically speaking, Reddit’s NFT launch is probably one of the largest to date. It’s a massive win for both the adoption of the Ethereum sidechain Polygon and for the NFT industry as a whole.\nDeGods\nWhile Ethereum NFTs still dominate the market by total volume traded, Solana NFTs are making waves and gaining traction thanks to buzzy NFT collections like DeGods. Created by the recently-doxxed entrepreneur who goes by “Frank,” DeGods is a collection of profile picture NFTs on Solana that offers a number of different benefits to holders.\nAfter a fumbled launch in late 2021, Frank and team stepped up the \"social experimentation,\" as he likes to call it, rolling out upgraded artwork to owners, offering daily-accruing DUST tokens to long-term holders, and even acquiring a controlling stake in a team in Ice Cube's BIG3 basketball league using DAO treasury funds.\nAD\nAD\nThose moves and others propelled DeGods to become the most valuable Solana NFT project this summer, ranking near Ethereum heavyweights in terms of USD value—and then they parlayed that hype into the even-buzzier y00ts project this fall. Dust Labs, an associated tech company, also raised $7 million to help build out an ecosystem around the projects.\nDeGods and y00ts helped elevate the Solana NFT space in 2022, although Frank dropped a big twist ahead for 2023: DeGods will be bridged to Ethereum while y00ts is bridged to Polygon, no longer limiting them to their original ecosystem. Once more, Frank is subverting expectations in the NFT space, although time will tell whether the moves hurt or help the projects (and Solana).\nPudgy Penguins\nMany NFT collections struggle to maintain steam and ultimately fade into oblivion—especially if a founder’s reputation is questioned. But this was not the fate of the Pudgy Penguins on Ethereum. It launched in July 2021 and lost traction after a few months, but saw a major renaissance in popularity this year after the collection was bought by young entrepreneur Luca Netz for $2.5 million in April and its original founder left the project.\nAt time of writing, Penguins have surged in value to near a 7 ETH floor price (i.e. the cheapest-listed NFT), which is over $8,000 each and a sizable increase from earlier this year. Under Netz’s reign, the collection made plans for merchandise, a children’s book, and more, and held an auction at Sotheby’s. The Penguins also snagged an advisory board made up of Web3 and retail professionals, with leaders from Nansen, Saks Fifth Avenue, Hasbro, and Meta joining to help the project further shape its comeback story."}, {"date": "2022-12-28 18:01:43", "entity": ["degods", "ethereum", "polygon", "ethereum", "polygon studios", "ethereum", "polygon", "coingecko", "solana", "solana", "solana", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "solana", "ftx", "solana", "coin", "sol", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "solana", "ftx", "alameda research", "solana", "sol", "solana", "ftx", "sbf", "solana", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "solana", "altcoin", "solana"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Positive", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "In brief Solana (SOL) fell below $10 early this morning for the first time since February 2021.\nThe cryptocurrency has shed 94% of its value since the beginning of 2022.\nEven with the prices for top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum sitting relatively stable over the last month, Solana has continued to bleed out.

The last time that Solana traded for less than $10 was in February 2021, just as the cryptocurrency was beginning its ascent.\nAD\nAD\nSix months later, Solana exploded in price and began a meteoric rise in value that would top out at nearly $260 per coin in November 2021. Since then, Solana has shed nearly 96% of its value, compared to a 76% drop for Bitcoin and Ethereum from their respective all-time highs the same month.\nSolana’s accelerated bleeding over the past several weeks was jump-started in large part by the collapse of FTX and Alameda Research, the two companies founded by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF). The one-time billionaire was a vocal supporter of Solana and had invested significantly in both SOL and the Solana ecosystem.\nAs the FTX empire crumbled in early November amid a liquidity crunch, the layer-1 blockchain platform's coin took a much harder hit than most leading cryptocurrencies, apparently due to the close association to SBF and his companies. SOL was valued above $37 in the days leading up to FTX’s downfall.\nAlthough Solana’s losses stabilized in early December, with the coin’s price hovering around the $13 mark, it has shed significant value over the past two weeks. SOL is down 8% today, 19% over the past week, and 29% over the past 30 days. Bitcoin is actually up 1% over the past 30 days, while Ethereum is down a fraction of a percentage point during the same span.\nSolana’s latest decline comes following news on December 25 that two of the blockchain platform’s most popular and valuable NFT projects, DeGods and y00ts, will be bridged to other platforms in early 2023 in an effort to expose them to larger audiences.\nDeGods will be bridged to Ethereum, letting users transfer their assets to the leading platform for NFTs and decentralized apps (dapps). Meanwhile, y00ts will be bridged to Polygon, an Ethereum scaling network, thanks in part to a grant from Polygon Studios to make the move.

According to the documents, on April 30, loans to the value of $316.6 million and $35.1 million were awarded to SBF and Wang respectively. Additionally, on May 15, two loans to the value of $175 million and $19.4 million were awarded to SBF.

The freeze had been implemented on November 16th, citing \"unprecedented market turmoil\" caused by the collapse of FTX.\nAs crypto progresses deep into its winter it remains to be seen how the case will progress and whether the plaintiffs will be successful in their claims. The Winklevoss twins will no doubt be hoping that their exchange weathers the incoming storm.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Those expectations weren’t without reason with the various infrastructure developments happening and venture firms continuing to pour more money into the industry.\nFTX hits $32 billion valuation\nFresh after a $420 million extension to its Series B fundraise in October 2021, crypto exchange FTX made a solid start to the year, raising $400 million in a Series C round, which propelled the firm’s valuation to a whopping $32 billion.\nInvestors at that time included Paradigm, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Temasek, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, IVP, Tiger Global, and even the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board, demonstrating the high level of trust and confidence in the Sam Bankman-Fried’s, also called SBF, business at the time.\nAs SBF said then, the Series C funds were expected to be used to fund mergers and acquisitions. Many of these acquisitions did indeed happen, but as we know now, the source of that funding wasn’t from its Series C.\nOther uses for the fresh cash included philanthropy, with FTX pledging up to $1 billion just a month later for \"ambitious projects in order to improve humanity's long-term prospects.\"\nMore money flowing into crypto\nThe announcement came just days after FTX US closed its own $400 million Series A round on January 26, which valued the U.S. arm at $8 billion. It also followed the launch of FTX Ventures, a $2 billion venture capital arm that sought to draw on FTX’s fast-growing global reach and resources, with the primary focus on Web3 gaming, as well as consumer and social Web3 applications.\nAD\nAD\nOther notable investments in Q1 2022 included infrastructure giant Fireblocks raising $550 million, interoperability and scaling framework Polygon and Ethereum software company ConsenSys both closing $450 million rounds, NFT and metaverse-backer Animoca Brands securing $358,888,888, and blockchain software company Alchemy and Ethereum NFT gaming startup Immutable both raising $200 million.\nOpenSea hits record $5B in monthly trading volume\nThe wider NFT market boomed alongside OpenSea.\nThe world's largest marketplace for non-fungible tokens and crypto collectibles smashed its previous records in January, posting more than $5 billion in trading volume between Ethereum and Polygon sales.\nThe January record still stands unbeaten by the end of 2022, and given the events that followed throughout the year, the question of when—if ever—it will be cracked remains.\nDOJ seizes $3.6 billion in Bitcoin from 2016 Bitfinex hack\nOn February 8, the Department of Justice (DOJ) announced the seizure of over $3.6 billion worth of Bitcoin linked to the infamous hacking incident of the Bitfinex exchange, as well as the arrest of a New York couple on charges of conspiracy to launder the stolen funds.\nWhile the seizure of Bitcoin linked to the Bitfinex hack was undoubtedly massive news in itself, the story was also quick to capture mainstream attention given the culprits’—Ilya Lichtenstein and his wife Heather—rather opulent and eccentric lifestyle.\nLichtenstein, an American of Russian origin, was giving online advice about tech and finance. He also had a YouTube channel where he acted as an amateur magician and mentalist. Morgan—known as “Razzlekhan” to her followers—had a YouTube channel on her own and also worked as a contributor at Forbes, where she wrote several articles, including one called \"Protect Your Business from Cybercriminals.\"\nLichtenstein, who was considered a flight risk, was denied bail and is currently in jail in Virginia, while Morgan has been released until her trial.\nPresident Biden signs crypto executive order\nOn March 9, President Biden signed the Executive Order on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets—the first \"whole-of-government\" approach to regulating the cryptocurrency industry.\nThe executive order aims to address multiple issues faced by the crypto space, including consumer protection, illicit finance, financial inclusion, and \"responsible development.” It also tasks federal agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission, the SEC, and the CFTC, to coordinate their oversight efforts.\nThe industry, however, was divided on the move. According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire the White House's intent to use a \"whole-of-government approach to at once harness opportunities while controlling and mitigating inherent risks in responsible innovation is encouraging.\"\nHuman Rights Foundation CSO Alex Gladstein, on the other hand, pointed out that the order is \"heavy on CBDCs\" and \"doesn't mention Bitcoin,\" suggesting it’s not all bad.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) quipped that she was \"unconvinced on the need for a central bank digital currency.\"\nEU parliament approves crypto legislative package\nIn the same month, the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) passed its Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) legislative package, which, like Biden’s bill, aims to coordinate the EU's regulatory approach to the crypto industry.\nAD\nAD\nOne of the top priorities of the legislation is \"ensuring that the EU financial services regulatory framework is innovation-friendly and does not pose obstacles to the application of new technologies.”\nThe package also takes aim at creating legal certainty for the industry and ensuring financial stability, which is also tied to what has been a less-than-stable stablecoin market.\nIn a separate move, the EU Parliament has voted to impose new regulatory measures that would essentially prohibit anonymous cryptocurrency transactions.\nTerra goes under\nThe dramatic meltdown of the Terra ecosystem was the major talking point during the second quarter of the year, as the implosion of the UST algorithmic stablecoin and its sister token LUNA in May wiped out $40 billion worth of investors' money in a week's time, shrinking the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies by almost $700 billion.\nAmid the crash, the price of LUNA, once a top 10 coin by market cap, fell 100% to a fraction of a cent, and UST, designed to hold 1:1 parity with the U.S. dollar, bottomed out at $0.13 cents.\nDespite facing numerous investigations into its collapse, as well as scores of lawsuits, Do Kwon, the CEO of the Singapore-based company Terraform Labs, has denied allegations that the project was a “fraud.”\nHe also claimed that he had personally lost nearly all his net worth in Terra’s crash.\nThen, at the end of May, the Terra community approved the re-launch of the project, which saw a new blockchain called Terra 2.0 being deployed, with the older collapsed network continuing to exist as “Terra Classic.”\nCrypto contagion creeps in\nTerra’s collapse was the year’s largest domino that led to insolvency troubles at crypto lending platform Celsius and cryptocurrency hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC).\nCiting “extreme market conditions” and a need to “stabilize liquidity,” Celsius announced that it was suspending all withdrawals on June 12, with 3AC receiving a liquidation order from a court in the British Virgin Islands on June 29.\nAD\nAD\nThe Singapore-based hedge fund bore a loss of roughly $200 million following Terra’s collapse, with crypto exchanges BitMEX, FTX, and Deribit liquidating the hedge fund’s positions after it failed to meet margin calls.\nIt didn’t end there, however, with broker Voyager Digital first revealing a $661 million in exposure to 3AC and—after the latter failed to make even partial payments—issuing a notice of default.\nAnother firm that moved to freeze user withdrawals was crypto derivatives exchange CoinFLEX, which too cited “continued uncertainty involving a counterparty.” CoinFLEX CEO Mark Lamb claimed at the time that the person responsible for the platform’s financial woes was none other than the longtime Bitcoin evangelist turned Bitcoin Cash promoter Roger Ver.\nExtreme market conditions also saw several high-profile crypto firms lay off their workforce. These included crypto exchanges Gemini, Crypto.com and Coinbase, as well as several companies in Latin America.\nBitcoin takes nosedive\nBitcoin was trading at $47,000 as of April 1. By the end of June, however, the leading cryptocurrency had more than halved, changing hands just above $20,000.\nAccording to data from blockchain analytics Skew, this was the worst quarterly performance for Bitcoin since Q3 of 2011, when the asset plummeted by 66.62%.\nBefore that, on June 18, BTC briefly plummeted below $18,000, while Ethereum followed the trend to fall below $900, adding more pain for investors.\nOver the same span, the combined market cap of all digital assets fell from just below $2 trillion to just above $890 billion.\nCrypto VC investments march on\nMarket carnage did nothing to cool investor sentiment, however.\nIn April, Pantera Capital secured $1.3 billion for its Blockchain Fund focused on Web3 startups, early-stage tokens, and digital tokens with established liquidity levels.\nBinance's US subsidiary announced an April \"seed round\" of more than $200 million, which brought the exchange’s valuation to $4.5 billion, while developers behind the open-source decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol 0x raised $70 million.\nAD\nAD\nVenture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) raised $4.5 billion for its fourth crypto-centric fund in May, bringing its total raised for crypto and blockchain investments to over $7.6 billion.\nA $725 million ecosystem fund was raised for the Flow blockchain platform in May, while Ethereum rival NEAR protocol raised $350 million in new funding the previous month.\nBlockchain data analytics firm Chainalysis secured $170 million in Series F funding in May, bringing its valuation to $8.6 billion.\nRegulatory headwinds\nIn April, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a new bill to regulate developers and exchanges working with digital commodities, including stablecoins and, ostensibly, Bitcoin.\nSponsored by Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-PA), the ranking Republican member of the House Agriculture Committee, the Digital Commodity Exchange Act of 2022—if passed—would expand the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) beyond its \"historical role as a derivatives regulator\" by letting the agency regulate spot trading of crypto commodities. In other words, the CFTC would regulate American crypto exchanges, such as Coinbase and Kraken.\nIn a separate move aimed at taking a significant amount of powers away from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in favor of the CFTC, Senators Cynthia Lummis (R-Wy) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced the Responsible Financial Innovation Act.\nThe bill introduced a raft of other significant measures, including a provision that eliminates the obligation to report crypto gains of $200 or less to the IRS. It also seeks to codify the \"Howey test,\" a Supreme Court doctrine from the 1940s that explains when an asset is a security and is widely used by the SEC to determine whether a digital asset should be classified as a security.\nMeanwhile, in Europe, the European Union reached a deal regarding anti-money laundering rules for crypto transactions.\nThe new rules aim to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by requiring crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) to collect and store information identifying crypto users with “no minimum thresholds nor exemptions for low-value transfers.”\nCASPs will also have to hand that information over to authorities conducting investigations.\nThe regulation does not apply, however, to transfers between individuals using wallets that do not utilize a service provider. This means, for instance, that an Ethereum transaction between two MetaMask wallets would not be subject to anti-money laundering checks—something the EU Parliament initially planned in March.\nTwitter greenlights Musk's $44 billion takeover bid\nOn April 25—not long after it rebuffed the billionaire's initial buyout attempt—the Twitter board accepted Elon Musk's $44 billion bid to buy the social media platform\nAD\nAD\nMusk, also the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, was initially set to join the board as the firm's largest individual shareholder but later backtracked, revealing his intent to buy Twitter outright and take the company private.\nIn a leaked Q&A session with Twitter employees in June, Musk shared further details of his earlier plans for how crypto could be used on the platform, expounding on how payments, including crypto, are a \"critical area\" for Twitter, while also highlighting the ongoing issue of crypto scams and bots."}, {"date": "2022-12-28 17:00:04", "entity": ["u. s. treasury department", "office of foreign assets control", "kraken", "outlook india", "tradingview. com", "tradingview. com", "kraken japan", "kraken", "exchange", "kraken", "terra", "ftx", "kraken", "kraken", "kraken", "japan financial services agency"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The crypto winter is a drawn-out one exacerbated by the collapse of large players such as Terra and the FTX crypto exchange. As crypto businesses continue to feel the effects of the current bear market, another major player, Kraken, has been affected to the point that it has, once again, put a pause on operations in Japan.\nKraken Consolidating For Crypto The Bear Market\nCrypto exchange Kraken plans to stop operations in the Japanese market. The exchange said this in a government publication in the country which states that it will deregister from the Japan Financial Services Agency (JFSA) on Jan. 31, 2023.\nThe company cites the current global crypto market state as the reason for this move, saying that “the resources needed to further grow our business in Japan aren’t justified at this time.” As such, the exchange plans to stop providing services to users in the country.\nThe decision comes just a month after Kraken revealed that it was laying off about 30% of its workforce. Given the size of the company and the amount of labor it employs, this came out to about 1,100 employees who lost their jobs at the crypto exchange.\nMarket cap drops to $759 billion amid prolonged bear market | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com\nAs for its users in Japan, the exchange assured that it would allow users to withdraw all of their funds held on the exchange. Users are advised to withdraw all of their fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies being held on Kraken Japan before the Jan. 31 date. Kraken says it has enough funds to enable all users to withdraw assets.\nIt further added:\n“We value the trust our clients put in us and we will do what we can to minimise the impact of our decision for you. That’s why we are committed to ensure a seamless transition and we hope the information in this email will help you decide what is the best option for you.”\nIn November, the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) fined Kraken over $362,000 over sanctions violation for providing access to users in Iran. The crypto exchange agreed to settle for this figure with an additional $100,000 committed to implementing sanctions compliance controls.\nFeatured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-28 16:30:00", "entity": ["##pto bitcoin", "binance", "ftx", "blockfi", "blockfi", "voyager", "ivanov ftx", "jpmorgan chase", "bank of england", "indian central bank", "shaktikanta das", "nft", "pokemon company", "pokemon", "alameda research", "ellison", "ethereum", "visa", "ethereum network", "altcoins", "sasha", "digital", "binance", ". us", "ftx", "alameda research", "ftx", "sec", "sec"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "A plea deal comes to the rescue of disgraced former CEO of Alameda Research, Caroline Ellison.

Japan has planned to make it easier for exchanges to list tokens in order to encourage further liberalization of the industry.\nAdditionally, the Financial Services Agency (FSA), which is the integrated financial regulator of Japan, has decided to put an end to the ban on the domestic distribution of foreign-issued stablecoins in the upcoming year.\nThis new stablecoin regulation in Japan will allow local exchanges to permit stablecoin trading such as USDT. The crypto industry’s governing body has notified its member companies about the new regulatory change, which is supposed to come into effect immediately.\nThis will help these companies to list their coins a lot easier as they will not need to undergo a detailed screening process.

The lack of confidence in the token since the FTX debacle has caused investors to sell $SOL even harder than most other cryptocurrencies, even though the Solana ecosystem was arguably the foremost layer 1 blockchain after Ethereum.\nVery worryingly, the odd project is jumping ship off the Solana ecosystem and into other ecosystems with perhaps perceived lower risk. DeGods, and Y00ts are two NFT projects that have recently announced their desire to leave Solana and port over to the Polygon ecosystem, the leading layer 2 blockchain for Ethereum.\nAlarming technicals\nFrom a technical aspect, things do look slightly alarming for $SOL holders. $10 dollars can certainly be a support level that is able to stop the rot from continuing. The support here goes back to February 2021, and of course, $10 is a nice round number.\nHowever, should the FUD persist and the $10 support breaks to the downside, the next step down, with nothing but thin air below, could take the token down to the next very strong support between $4 to $5 dollars.\nThis would be quite some collapse since the November 2021 high of $260 when everything appeared to be going so well for Solana.\nMake or break\nFor the time being, investors will have to weigh up their options. Getting in at $4 to $5 could be the most incredible opportunity if the ship rights itself and the lightning fast network eventually fulfils all its early promise.\nOn the other hand though, should not even $4 hold, and the current bank run-like sell-off continue apace, then it could spell the end of an incredibly innovative project in the crypto space.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Most of these have revolved around the possibility of MicroStrategy having to sell off its bitcoin. However, the company has just put all of these rumors to bed with another massive BTC purchase.\n2,395 BTC For $42.8 Million\nIn an SEC filing that was made public on Wednesday, MicroStrategy Incorporated announced that it has made another bitcoin purchase. The company said it bought a total of 2,395 BTC this time around. At an average of around $17,871, the recent haul cost the company approximately $42.8 million to purchase. The purchase was made between the period of Nov. 1 and Dec. 21, 2022.\nThe filing also reveals other developments regarding the company and its bitcoin holders. MicroStrategy had sold 704 BTC worth $11.8 million on Dec. 22 after buying the 2,395 BTC. The company obviously took a loss for this sale, selling each BTC at an average price of $16,776 but says that it plans to carry the capital losses for the sale against its previous capital gains which would lead to a tax benefit for the country.\nTwo days later, the company would purchase another 810 BTC for an average price of $16,845. This cost it $13.6 million in cash, bringing the company’s purchases over the less than two-month period to $56.4 million in total.\nNow, MicroStrategy’s holdings have ballooned once more and the company is now holding 132,500 BTC, the largest of any publicly held company in the world.\nBTC price sitting at $16,648 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\nWhat Does MicroStrategy Do With Bitcoin?\nPrevious CEO Michael Saylor led the company when it started acquiring BTC and saw it accumulate more than 128,000 BTC during his tenure. At the time, Saylor had said that the company was buying BTC because it believed in the long-term potential of the digital asset, and there has not been a change to this since then.\nEven during the bear market when crypto companies are going bankrupt, MicroStrategy has held on to the majority of its BTC. The company has shown no indication of selling and its most recent purchase shows its commitment to its BTC agenda.\nThe aggregate average price of the company’s BTC holdings is now sitting at $30,397 per BTC, as well as fees and expenses related to each purchase, bringing the total to $4.03 billion.

As NewsBTC reported, the rumor originated from an anonymous source in the Terra Classic community.\nHowever, the credibility of the rumor is more than questionable. Nevertheless, the community seemed to believe the rumor that Coinbase has approved the purchase of $245 million in LUNC and will make the listing on the exchange public on January 3.\nThe price subsequently rose from a low of $0.000125988 on Dec. 22 to a three-week high of $0.000185499 on Dec. 27. With this, the Terra Luna predecessor token saw a price increase of around 46%, bucking the current market trend.\nHowever, the euphoria was dampened today by Binance after the crypto exchange announced that it is making changes to the Terra Classic trading fee burn.\nBinance stated that following recent developments as outlined in proposal 10983 and proposal 11111, it will burn 50% of LUNC spot and margin trading fees instead of 100% starting in December 2022. By doing so, Binance is following the community’s proposals that LUNC burn will be converted into a development fund.\nBinance’s change is thus done in line with the community’s intent to further reduce LUNC supply and in line with what they have agreed upon. To allow time for these new updates to be implemented, Binance will delay sending out the LUNC trading fee burn postings until January 3, 2023.\n“Binance will continue to work with the community to support the implementation of this new plan, and if for any reason this is not possible, Binance will consider removing the burn contribution in the future,” the exchange added.\nLUNC Price Poised For More Gains?\nSince the high on December 27, the LUNC price has already lost about 16% of its price appreciation again. At press time, Terra Classic was trading at $0.000157195, down 11% over the last 24 hours. The trading volume within the same period was $245 million, down a modest -1.4% from the previous period.\nA look at the 1-day chart reveals that on Boxing Day, the Terra Classic price managed to break out of a downtrend channel that has persisted since October. Today’s correction could represent a retest of the move, so traders should keep an eye on the $0.0001406 area.\nSupport could also be provided by the 50-day simple moving average (SMA), which sits at $0.000162919. Otherwise, the 200-day SMA at $0.000179240 should be decisive as the next resistance for the Terra Classic price.\nFeatured image from The VR Soldier, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-28 13:57:42", "entity": ["coinmarketcap", "coin", "uni", "uniswap", "uniswap", "uni", "uni", "binance funding", "uniswap", "uniswap", "uniswap", "uniswap", "uni", "uniswap", "uni", "uni", "coinmarketcap", "uni price", "uniswap", "uni", "tradingview. com", "uniswap", "uni nfts", "nft", "uni"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "Uniswap (UNI) has surged in the social dominance department, peaking on December 25 at 20.46%.

The relevant indicator here is the “whale transaction count,” which measures the total number of Bitcoin transfers taking place on the chain on any given day, that are valued at $1 million or more.\nWhen the value of this indicator is high, it means there are a large number of massive movements happening in the market right now, suggesting that whales are actively trading. On the other hand, low values suggest these humongous holders aren’t making many moves at the moment.\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin whale transaction count over the last five years or so:\nLooks like the value of the metric has hit pretty low points in recent days | Source: Santiment\nAs the above graph displays, the Bitcoin whale transaction count has trended down as the bear market has become longer. The indicator has now reached quite low levels relative to the average for 2021 and 2022, and in fact, the current values are the lowest since December 2020.\nThis means that whales are showing little interest in trading BTC at the moment. While this means that these investors aren’t adding any significant selling pressure right now, it also implies that they have not been accumulating much either. This is the reason why the cryptocurrency’s price has been stuck in endless consolidation lately.\nSantiment points out that a strong correlation between the whale transaction count and the Bitcoin value has historically existed, as is visible in the chart. Bull runs have generally seen very high activity from this cohort, while bears have seen a slowdown like the one being observed currently.\nInterestingly, periods of bearish trends have generally reversed when the whale transaction count has spiked up at points when the price has been going down. Such activity suggests interest is back from this cohort to trade the crypto, and the resulting accumulation takes the price up.\nThere have been some spikes in the metric recently as well, but they have generally coincided with uplifts in the price. Thus, they were likely because of distribution (and not accumulation). Now it remains to be seen when the whales return to trading the coin in full force and cause a bullish reversal in the price.\nBTC Price\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16,600, down 1% in the last week.

However, his claims of “legal open market actions” seem unfounded, as he has been charged with market manipulation and fraud.\nA previously sealed complaint filed with the Southern District of New York was made public recently, revealing that the FBI had charged Eisenberg with one count of commodities fraud and one count of commodities manipulation in the Mango Markets case.\nEisenberg’s Mango Market Takedown\nThe takedown of the crypto exchange took place in the month of October 2022, which is already being touted as “Hacktober” in the crypto circles due to the overwhelming number of hacks and exploits. Eisenberg targeted the platform’s native token, MNGO, and artificially inflated its price with respect to the USDC. His team then proceeded to take significant loans against their inflated collateral, thus draining the Mango treasury of cryptocurrencies worth $110 million. Eisenberg had, however, never attempted to hide his identity or his actions, claiming that whatever profits he had gained were part of a regular trading activity. In fact, he had even entered into negotiations with the Mango team immediately after the maneuver to discuss the return of the funds. Days later, the Mango team revealed that around $67 million of various crypto assets had been returned to the exchange treasury.\nFBI Deems Eisenberg Guilty\nHowever, the FBI did not buy into Eisenberg’s claims of the entire exploit being just a “profitable trading strategy.” on December 23, the federal agency lodged a formal complaint alleging that Eisenberg had wilfully and knowingly manipulated the market and committed fraud through intentional and artificial manipulation of the price of the perpetual futures on Mango Markets. The funds that he drained from the exchange’s treasury came directly from the deposits of other investors.\nIn fact, according to FBI special agent Brandon Racz.

He added that the crypto space is not regulated well enough. Since Friday, Dec. 16, ADA has lost a staggering 16%, dropping from $0.30 to $0.25 at the moment.\nIt was here that Mike Alfred stepped in. He believes that, at the moment, ADA in particular is coming close to the targets he set 18-24 months ago, even though back at that time they seemed unlikely.\nOverall, Alfred reckons that this bearish phase will end within the period of three to nine months.\nOr it's just a bear market. We're getting near my ADA price targets from 18-24 months ago. Felt very unlikely at the time. But that's always the case at extremes.

Created by former Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, the coin is 91.6% below its all-time high of $3.10, which was reached on September 1, 2021. Thus, ADA is performing much worse than its main competitor Ethereum. ETH reached its all-time high of $4.878 on November 10, 2021, and is currently about -75.4% below that level.\nHowever, according to on-chain analytics service Santiment, there are early signs of a trend reversal. For instance, sharks and whales holding 100,000 to 10 million ADA have been accumulating aggressively over the past six weeks. As the analyst writes, there is currently a bullish divergence between price and whale activity.\nA look at realized gains and losses also paints a bullish picture. According to the analyst, there are signs of seller exhaustion. “On every big price decrease there are fewer and fewer coins moving at a loss,” the analyst notes.\nFurthermore, the Santiment analyst says that Cardano (ADA) is facing a trading volume gap in the $0.19 to $0.26 range, where he expects the price to see “serious buying.”\n“Based on the things mentioned above, I believe price will increase in value. However, without any other data, it is difficult to accurately assess the validity of this analysis,” the analyst concluded.\nMessari Research Assesses The Current State Of Cardano\nAn analysis of the state of the Cardano network was also published yesterday by Messari. In the research, the company provides interesting insights into the growth of the network, but at the same time, how it is lagging behind its main competitors.\nAs Messari notes, Cardano experienced an increase in DeFi activity in 2022, with daily transactions leveling off at around 60,000 since the second quarter, which equates to an average of around 0.75 transactions per second (TPS).\nCardano’s DeFi TVL was approximately $78 million at the end of the third quarter of 2022. With a market cap of $14.8 billion, the project has a market cap/TVL ratio of 190, significantly higher than competitors Ethereum, Solana, and Binance with ratios of 6, 17, and 10, respectively, Messari said.\nDespite its relatively late entry into the DeFi space, Cardano’s TVL ranks 30th, with Minswap, WingRiders, and SundaeSwap dominating the DeFi ecosystem with 52%, 20%, and 19% market shares, respectively.\nIn the NFT space, Cardano is hosting 8,000 NFT projects and 15 marketplaces but is only generating an average monthly volume of $6.8 million. This, as Messari notes, is a far cry from industry leader Ethereum, which has over $150 million in monthly volume.\nAccording to the analytics firm, Cardano’s ethos of “building carefully and deliberately with extensive reviews” is one reason it forfeited a potential first-mover advantage with its proof of stake. According to Messari, the goal of the Hoskinson-led project must be to catch up with established ecosystems and capture market share in the near future.\n[…] its market cap and decentralization are ahead of most competitors. However, Cardano’s ecosystem is still far behind the competition despite its growth this year. Cardano’s goal in the near future will be to catch up to established ecosystems and take some market share.\nADA Price Trapped In Downtrend\nA look at the 1-day chart reveals that the ADA price has been in a downtrend channel since August, which could spell further doom. At a current price of $0.251, the ADA price is as low as it was last in January 2021.\nTo initiate an uptrend, ADA would first need to reclaim the 50-day moving average at around $0.30 in order to break out of the trend channel at around $0.34.\nFeatured image from AnTa_ranga / Pixabay, Charts from Santiment and TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-28 12:25:00", "entity": ["ethereum", "ethereum"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "But the Merge wasn’t all good news.

But dating back to the start of the year, the message contains one very interesting thing.\nIt suggests that the pseudonymous developer of the popular meme coin intends to reveal himself to the SHIB army by the end of this year.\n\"Impossible for me to remain invisible\"\nThe message of Shytoshi Kusama says that after talking to his mentor, they arrived at the conclusion that Shytoshi cannot \"remain invisible\" anymore since you just do not \"align and stay invisible and disrupt the industry.\" When it happens, the message also says, \"then the real fun begins.\" This line sort of promises a surprise, perhaps related to the actual personality behind the Shytoshi Kusama pseudonym, when it is revealed to the SHIB army and crypto community in general.\nThey both agreed that Kusama's ceasing to stay invisible (remain under his alias) should happen by the end of the year; the message is dated Jan. 21, 2022.\nGoing further than Satoshi and Ryoshi\nThe trend of pseudonyms of famous personalities in the crypto sphere goes back to the person(s) who invented Bitcoin and left it in the hands of the BTC community: Satoshi Nakamoto. The founder of Shiba Inu took the alias Ryoshi.\nThe latter preferred to disappear and go off the radar earlier this year, apparently wishing to copycat the path chosen by the legendary Bitcoin creator. However, Shytoshi Kusama, if he indeed wants to get rid of his Satoshi-like alias and get on living and developing SHIB under his real name, intends to outdo both of the aforementioned crypto creators. Quite possibly, he also intends to attract more attention to Shiba Inu meme cryptocurrency and, who knows, maybe even attempt to affect the price of the coin by taking this step.\nAt the moment, things are not good with the SHIB price. The meme coin is trading 90.97% below the all-time high it reached in October last year, $0.00008845. The current price of the meme coin is $0.00000797 after it dropped sharply by more than 2% earlier today.

In 2017, the company added official support for accepting payments in Bitcoin. Support for Bitcoin payments started from version 3.11 of ProtonMail, allowing users to pay for the premium ProtonMail service using BTC. At the time, ProtonMail stated,\n“We have designed the payment system to work seamlessly so that Bitcoin payments are automatically converted to ProtonMail credits which can be used to pay for upgrades, pay invoices, or top up your account. This feature was long overdue, so we are glad to finally introduce this.”\nThe company also added that it viewed holding cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin as a hedge against the uncertainty and fragility of the traditional financial sector, stating that it currently holds a significant portion of its reserves in Bitcoin.\nA Change In Outlook\nProtonMail acknowledged in 2019 that the company had been holding the BTC sent to them by customers. However, the recent downturn in the crypto markets has prompted Proton CEO and founder, Andy Yen, to cast doubt on whether the company will continue to hold BTC in the future. Yen made the comments during an interview with Forbes, published on the 27th of December, 2022.\nYen, while acknowledging that the company held Bitcoin in reserve, added that it isn’t guaranteed that the firm may continue to do so.\n“There’s an internal debate: I don’t have the answer to that yet — I’m not sure if we continue to hold Bitcoin or not hold Bitcoin.”\nA Number Of Concerns\nYen discussed his thoughts about Bitcoin and crypto in general, adding that several factors concerned him. According to the CEO, these were largely tied to fraud, the numerous scams, and short-lived bubbles such as the recent NFT bubble and the ICO craze of 2017. Additionally, he stated that the short-lived interest in crypto is cyclical and short-lived, leading to spikes and crashes that decimate the crypto markets every three to four years. Yen elaborated during the interview, stating,\n“People are not going to have faith and confidence and trust in an asset class if it is frequently having 80% crash cycles. We need the crash cycles to be less and less severe over time, and that’s just not happening.”\nSelf Regulation And Moderation Are Key\nSo how does one address the issue? According to Yen, more robust moderation and self-regulation within the crypto sector are key to confronting the problem, adding that he opposed lawmakers' regulation. However, the skepticism displayed by the ProtonMail CEO does not mean the firm would stop accepting Bitcoin payments and transactions. In fact, reports have suggested that the firm is currently in the process of integrating Lightning Network payments.\nProton’s close association and work with cryptocurrencies in 2018 also saw rumors that it was planning on launching its own token through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). However, the firm categorically denied such rumors at the time.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The relevant indicator here is the “Litecoin Supply Distribution,” which tells us how many addresses (or holders) belong to each wallet group in the market currently.\nAddresses are put into these wallet groups based on the total number of coins that they are currently holding. For example, the 1-10 coins band includes all addresses that are holding between 1 and 10 LTC right now. The Supply Distribution metric for this band would then measure the total amount of such addresses that are there in the market currently.\nNow, the wallet groups of interest in the current discussion are those with at least 1,000 LTC. Since there is no upper bound here, all balances ranging from this amount to infinity are stacked together. Here is the Supply Distribution chart for these Litecoin address bands:\nLooks like the value of the metric has been sharply going up in recent days | Source: Santiment\nAs the above graph displays, the value of the indicator for Litecoin addresses falling inside this range has been rising since May of this year. Holders that have 1,000 or more coins in their wallets are sharks and whales, so this uptrend implies that the total number of these large investors has been going up in the last few months.\nJust recently, the address count of these holders hit a value of 4,232, which is the highest value recorded in more than two years. From the chart, it’s also visible that while these sharks and whales have been increasing in number (and hence accumulation has been going on), the LTCBTC ratio has seen a rise of more than 130%.\nSince this accumulation hasn’t seemed to have slowed down recently, it’s possible that it could sustain further appreciation in the price of Litecoin heading into 2023.

This stands in stark contrast to SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, who is not only leading the case against Ripple but has also opined on several occasions that pretty much every crypto token is a security.\nIn the indictment, the Justice Department writes unequivocally of CRV and MNGO tokens as commodities. It states:\nAVRAHAM EISENBEG, the defendant witifully and knowingly, directly and Indirectly, used […] in connection with swap, a contract of sale of a commodity in interstate and foreclosure commerce, and for future delivery on and subject to the rules of a registered entity, a manipulative and deceptive device and contrivance, in contravention of Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 180.1, […]\nFor Ripple, the DoJ may have provided another argument that the legal situation for cryptocurrencies is not as clear as the SEC always claims. Since both CRV and MNGO are designated as commodities, it is at least reasonable to assume that XRP is a commodity and not a security.\nRemarkably, these documents were filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in the Southern District of New York, the same court where the case between Ripple and the SEC is taking place.\nIs It All Just Strategy?\nGabriel Shapiro, General Counsel at Delphi Labs, commented that the fact that the case does not classify the relevant tokens as securities is in no way positive. According to Shapiro, the classification is simply a result of litigation strategy. “The fewer predicate issues the govt has to litigate in its case, the better.”\nScott Lewis, co-founder of DeFi Pulse agrees with Shapiro and stated that the government is not announcing a new policy toward tokens with this document. Nevertheless, inconsistent policy toward crypto tokens is evident, he said.\n*All* government policy is a litigation strategy. Including Ripple and LBRY enforcement actions.\nMatt Feinberg, an attorney at Falcon Rappaport & Berkman LLP added:\nMaybe. But that’s because they believe it’s easier to prove that its a commodity, which infers that the commodity theory makes the most sense from a practical standpoint.

Still, according to several reports, he received “special treatment” and privileges that other prisoners are denied.\nDespite recent events, Clayton believes people should focus on prosecutors having a suspect in custody and evidence to defend their case. On the $250 million bail, the former SEC boss claims the court tries to discourage suspects and their families from avoiding the legal process.\nAbout SBF’s possibilities and his future choices, about whether a life sentence in prison is the “answer,” Clayton took the FTX former CEO’s point of view. He said:\nAll of these things will be the subject of negotiation if there is a plea arrangement.

Over the last 24 hours, ADA has dipped about 0.2%. The ADA has gained 4% in the last week, indicating a positive trend. According to the technical outlook, the Cardano price has not yet reversed its price action.\nThe downtrend continues despite the coin securing minor gains over the last few days. The buying strength remained low, which depicted lower accumulation as well. Cardano bounced back from oversold territory, but the selling momentum was still strong.\nWith the Bitcoin price falling and fluctuating between $16,900 and $16,600, altcoins have also seen choppy and undecided price movements. Following major market movers, ADA traded between $0.26 and $0.27, with the altcoin falling below the $0.25 price mark in the last 24 hours.\nThe market has presented signs where buyers can make an entry to make some gains over the shorter trading timeframe. The trading volume of Cardano was low, indicating a lack of buyers. ADA is trading 91% below its all-time high secured in the last year.\nCardano Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\nADA was trading at $0.25 at the time of writing. Because of the recent depreciation, ADA has lost its $0.26 support line. If buyers push harder, Cardano can be expected to trade above the $0.26 level again. The major mark of resistance for ADA stood at $0.28.\nAs per the technical indicators, Cardano price might lose the $0.25 level before it starts to make upward strides again.\nThat would mark an entry point for buyers and an appropriate shorting opportunity for traders. If the Cardano price fell below the $0.25 mark, the first support stood at $0.24 and then at $0.22. The amount of Cardano traded in the last session declined, signifying bearish price action.\nTechnical Analysis\nDespite Cardano recovering from the undervalued zone, it still hovered close to the selling dominance zone. The Relative Strength Index was below the 40-mark with a downtick, which could lead to another fall in price before the altcoin makes a comeback.\nThe Cardano price was below the 20-Simple Moving Average (SMA) line, which meant sellers continued to drive the price momentum in the market. Traders shorting will make gains over the next trading sessions as ADA prepares to topple past the 20-SMA line.\nBearish conditions prevailed for Cardano, as the other indicators also pointed in the same direction. The Directional Movement Index (DMI), which demonstrates the price direction and strength, was negative. The -DI line (orange) was above the -DI line (blue), indicating that sellers had more strength in the market.\nThe Average Directional Index (red) was at 40, depicting increased strength in the current price direction. This reiterated that the bears were strong, which would mean another fall for ADA, which could benefit sellers.\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence portrays the price momentum.

In terms of Google searches, SHIBA and DOGE showed mixed results.\nAccording to the report, the meme coin recorded around 1,290,000 monthly searches in the U.S., but in terms of global monthly searches, Dogecoin took the crown. This cryptocurrency recorded around 6,000,000 monthly searches compared to the 4,400,000 million from SHIBA.\nDOGE To See Further Growth In Popularity\nPer the report, the dominant trends in the crypto industry can be divided into meme coins, represented by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and innovative contract platforms, represented by Ethereum and Avalanche.\nFinally, people took an interest in old cryptocurrencies revamping their ecosystem with new features, represented by Cardano and Litecoin. As seen in the chart below, Ethereum was the most popular in the group after DOGE and SHIB.\nIn this group, Dogecoin has a high chance of preserving its place on this ranking in 2023.

There has been an increase in the hashrate since then but the worst may not be over yet.\nBitcoin Hashrate Takes A Beating\nElectricity grids across the United States came under immense pressure as the country recorded one of its coldest winters yet. Temperatures dropped drastically across various states and the electricity grid was stretched thin to provide enough energy to heat homes. As a result, a number of bitcoin miners decided to pause their operations to free up some energy and this affected the hashrate contributed by the country.\nBy Christmas Day, the global hashrate had tanked almost 40%, dropping from its Dec. 24 peak of 276 exahashes per second (EH/s) to 175 EH/s. However, there was a 39% increase in hashrate on the same day which brought it back up to around 244 EH/s.\nBTC mining hashrate sees sharp decline on Christmas Day | Source: CoinWarz\nSince then, the hashrate has continued to wobble day to day and has now dropped back to the 212 EH/s level once more.

An example of this was back in July when Riot Blockchain had to shut off its mining machines in Texas as the state faced a heat wave.\nRelated Reading: Bearish Indicator: Bitcoin Volatility Hits All-Time Low\nGiven this, the bitcoin mining hashrate is expected to trend low for another couple of days before bouncing back up.

However, just months after the upgrade, a new problem has reared its head and that is how much easier it is to sanction ETH transactions.\n60% Of Ethereum Blocks Follow OFAC\nBack in August, the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed sanctions on multiple decentralized applications (DApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. These sanctions mainly focused on crypto mixers such as Tornado Cash and Blender which were accused of providing North Korean hackers a way to launder the money they stole from crypto investors.\nTornado Cash itself was said to have been used to launder more than $7 billion in crypto in three years since it was created. The sanctions led to the eventual shutdown of Tornado Cash and one of the developers were arrested by Dutch authorities.\nNow, three months later, the majority of Ethereum blocks are now compliant with the OFAC sanctions. This chart below from MEV Watch shows, per 100 blocks, how many are enforcing OFAC censorship, and it comes out to more than 60% of blocks being OFAC compliant.\nOver 60% of ETH blocks are OFAC compliant | Source: MEW Watch\nThis means that the majority of Ethereum blocks are not adding transactions that have interacted with sanctioned applications such as Tornado Cash, drawing criticism of the network and how truly decentralized it is if this is happening.\nA New Threat\nThere have been numerous allegations that moving Ethereum to a proof-of-stake mechanism had made it easier for authorities to control the transactions that can be carried out on the network. MEV Watch lists the seven major mev-boost relays, of which four were currently operating and censoring transactions according to OFAC sanctions.\nThese relays not including any transactions from wallets or smart contracts that have been sanctioned by OFAC deal a significant blow to the decentralization of Ethereum. If all relays were to comply with these requirements, it would mean that the government could successfully blacklist a wallet on a blockchain that is meant to be decentralized and keep that address from being able to transact – just like with a blacklisted bank account.\nTo successfully bypass this threat of complete censorship, validators need to make sure that when setting up their mev-boost configuration, they do not add these relays censoring transactions according to OFAC requirements. The more validators add censorship-compliant relays to their configurations, the more transactions are censored.\nLeaderboard of censorship-compliant entities | Source: MEV Watch\nThe MEV Watch website also includes a list of what it calls the “Censorship Offenders Leaderboard” listing the entities who are running censorship-compliant mev relays in their validators.

In the ad, David plays a succession of historical figures who dismiss great inventions out of hand, before shifting to the present day.

The below chart contains data about the top ten public Bitcoin mining companies, displaying information such as how much each of them mined this year, the amounts that they sold, and the size of their current holdings:\nLooks like Marathon is holding the largest reserve right now | Source: Tom Dunleavy on Twitter\nIn total, the ten largest mining companies in the space mined a collective 40.7 BTC this year and sold 40.3 BTC. This means that they roughly dumped the entire supply that they mined in 2022 and in the process, applied constant selling pressure on the network.\nEarlier in the year, Ethereum successfully transitioned to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, which means the blockchain no longer uses miners for handling transactions, and rather uses stakers (investors that have locked 32 ETH in the PoS contract) to act as validating nodes.\nIn a Proof-of-Work (PoW) system, miners compete with each other using large amounts of computing power. Therefore, many expenses are involved in getting up their facilities, but one cost, in particular, stays with them as long as they continue to operate: the electricity bills. It is because of these electricity bills that miners have to continuously sell what they mine to keep their business sustainable.\nSome miners try to hold onto their reserves for as long as possible, like Marathon, and Hut8 can be seen doing in the chart. Still, in a market like right now, where electricity prices have shot up while the BTC price has plummeted due to the bear, margins are fine for the already debt-ridden public miners, and thus most of them can’t afford to accumulate.\nIn the case of a PoS chain, however, stakers don’t incur such expenses and thus don’t have any particular need to sell the rewards they earn while staking. This implies that the type of selling pressure that miners put on Bitcoin isn’t present on the Ethereum blockchain.\nThe analyst believes that this fact provides a good thesis to be bullish on the ETHBTC ratio.\nEthereum Price\nAt the time of writing, ETH is trading around $1,200, down 1% in the last week.\nThe value of the crypto doesn't seem to have moved much during the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Pierre Borthiry – Peiobty on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-27 17:11:02", "entity": ["lbank", "lbank", "lbank", "alibaba cloud", "lbank", "alibaba cloud", "lbank", "lbk blockchain co. limited", "amazon", "lbank", "lbank", "lbank", "wei", "lbank"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "INTERNET CITY, DUBAI, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire\nA temporary outage of LBank’s trade platform in December sparked discussion among users about how exchanges should approach cloud hosting. LBank CEO Allen Wei addressed the issue during a Twitter Space AMA on December 26th.\nWhy this matters: Veteran crypto exchanges like LBank are trying to uphold a long-standing reputation of seeing little service downtime and thwarting hackers.\nDriving the discussion: Alibaba Cloud, LBank’s Cloud Service Provider, experienced technical issues on December 18th, rendering the trading platform temporarily inaccessible for over 7 million users.\n“Our engineers got word from Alibaba Cloud that there was a server crash ongoing and immediately started collaboration. It took quite some time to recover our services, but luckily we recovered access to our websites through other cloud services quite early on. The incident not only affected us, but a lot of other exchanges and internet companies,” Wei said.\nLBank stresses that these kinds of outages have no impact on user assets whatsoever. “We take regular back-ups of platform data. The wallet side is especially secure because we utilize cold storage controlled by our own servers,” Wei added.\nAddressing the FUD that popped up on social media during the incident, Wei stated this phenomenon isn’t an abnormality in the financial industry. “We’ve been through this before ever since kicking off in 2015 and are nonetheless still supporting crypto and blockchain tech. The community continues to trust us and trade on our platform, which underlines the potential of crypto,” the LBank CEO said.\nThe Big Picture: Wei points out that exchanges should approach cloud hosting with a multipronged strategy.\nThe exchange will take even more frequent back-ups of platform data in the future and will look towards other Cloud Service Providers to mitigate downtime. “We are slowly moving some of our services to other Cloud Providers, like Amazon”, Wei stated.\nContinuing to provide excellent stability of the trading platform is an integral part of LBank’s global goals, Wei said. “In 2023, we would also like to expand on the local community relations we established this year”, he concluded.\nAbout LBank\nLBank, founded in 2015, is an innovative global trading platform for various crypto assets. The exchange provides its users with safe crypto trading, specialized financial derivatives, and professional asset management services.

The tokens which can be mined directly from a smartphone have been working on moving to the mainnet, and it seems that this move will finally bring to pass what the community craves the most – an exchange listing.\nHuobi Says Pi Network Is A Possibility\nOn Monday, crypto exchange Huobi Global posted an announcement on its website that outlined what it was doing in regard to the Pi Network listing. The crypto exchange revealed to the community that it was following the upcoming mainnet launch of the cryptocurrency and that after this, it planned to review Pi for a possible listing on the exchange.\nThe mainnet launch is expected to come with a full Web3 experience where developers will be able to build decentralized applications (DApps) on top of the Pi Network. The launch is expected to take place in two phases: a Closed and an Open Mainnet launch. This two-pronged approach is reportedly in an effort to allow more time for more apps to be created, as well as move apps existing on the testnet to the mainnet.\nThis comes at a time of rising uncertainty about the future of the Pi Network given how long it has been in existence. The Christmas Day post read:\n“Huobi has always been committed in supporting top projects in their community relations. With the positive recommendation of Pi Network’s community, Huobi will follow up closely with Pi Network’s updates regarding the upcoming mainnet launch. Once the main network is upgraded successfully, Pi will be reviewed for listing at the soonest.”\nA Burgeoning Community\nThe Pi Network community reportedly consists of over 30 million users. Its official Twitter account currently boasts over 2 million followers, surpassing the likes of Cardano and Litecoin on the platform. The move to a complete Web3 platform is the latest in a series of developments that have come out of the Pi Network team while headed to its mainnet launch.\nDecentralized applications are already being launched on the platform. PiBridge, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the blockchain, recently announced its IDO for its native token. Pi Network itself has released the Pi browser that supports both Web2 applications and decentralized applications on Web3.\nThe Pi Network mainnet launch was previously expected to happen in mid-2022.

The digital asset which has now been reduced to the meme coin level still produces massive gains. Presently, LUNC is seeing double-digit gains even at a time when the majority of the market remains muted in terms of price performance.\nTerra Classic Pulls Big Gains\nTerra Classic (LUNC) saw a massive rally on Boxing Day that solidified massive gains for investors. Over the last 24 hours, LUNC has been able to rally more than 16% and has successfully broken resistance at the $0.00018 price level.\nThe price recovery follows a return of positive sentiment in the community as a new developer task force called the “Joint L1 Task Force” has proposed to build a Layer 1 Terra Classic blockchain. This comes as the community looks to move on from “Terra Rebels,” the first LUNC developer task force that is now plagued by various accusations. The community has already called for a return of $150,000 that was allocated to the task force previously.\nIn addition, the Terra Classic community has also voted in favor of Proposal 11111. This proposal reduces the allocation of burned LUNC tokens within an epoch to the community to 10%, revoking the 50% that was previously proposed in Proposal 10983. This effectively reduces the number of tokens that would be brought back into circulation after being burned.\nTerra Classic price jumps above $0.00018 | Source: LUNCUSD on TradingView.com\nThe proposal passed with 83.35% of votes being in favor and only 11.31% being against. The excitement from this news has also contributed to the rally in the price of the digital asset.\nMore Gains For LUNC?\nTerra Classic (LUNC) is currently sitting at the top of the list of top gainers on Coinmarketcap over the past 24 hours. With an approximately 17% jump in the last day, the digital asset defies a market that has seen slow movement, especially with bitcoin volatility dropping to all-time lows.\nTerra Classic tops lists of gainers | Source: Coinmarketcap\nLUNC, on the other hand, tends to thrive in times like these. This is because, with the low momentum, larger assets such as bitcoin and ethereum are unlikely to move much, but with low-price cryptocurrencies such as LUNC, it presents an opportunity for investors since it is easier to move the needle. Couple this with the recent rise in positive sentiment in the community and it is a recipe for success.\nIts price has now reached its second-highest level for the month of December after successfully touching above $0.00018 in the early hours of Tuesday.

Technology has also been upgrading itself, and that has also made the crypto scammers upgrade their mechanisms to swindle funds from crypto users.\nScam organizations, after the FTX issue, are now after the cryptocurrency industry. They operate by initiating millions of automated calls and text messages to millions of users through an auto-dialing mechanism.\nAuto-dialing is a common practice among fraudsters including Robocallers and it is used to conduct most scams. These automated calls and text messages deceive users and exploit their information to get hold of their funds.\nClayton LiaBraaten, who is the senior executive adviser at Truecaller, a software company that is used to identify scam calls and messages, mentioned that scammers especially stay updated about the crypto news in order to identify and target their victims better.\nHe stated:\nFraudsters love volatility and current events. Anytime they can try to surf the contours of something very disruptive in the marketplace they have a great deal of success.\nIt has also been reported that after extorting money, robocallers have upgraded their services and even formed an organization with expert scammers.\nOther Kinds Of Crypto Scams\nLiaBraaten also mentioned that there is a particular way that these automated robocalls operate. These entities launch millions of automated robocalls in one go, which then gives rise to fear and curiosity. These are the two elements that scammers depend on to obtain information.\nFor instance, if scammers have to get phone numbers, they do it in various ways. One is using tools to scour social networks for data and the second, depending on data breaches where a lot of information is leaked.\nThe most common scam witnessed by Truecaller is known as the ‘imposter scam.’ Imposter scammers have multiplied across various sectors where they perform this scam.\nThey disguise themselves as a support desk or another such entity from a renowned crypto business or exchange. The scammer then publishes their contact information on a website that looks identical to the authentic website to disguise themselves.\nYounger Population Targetted By Robocallers\nScammers are often people who have insight into people’s psychology and are social engineers who will try to find ways to bring out information by being contextually relevant. The younger generation is more at risk owing to the limitless information that people put online.\nThese allow the scammers to send messages and target their calls with relevant information to ensure that the communications keep their victims hooked. Reports also suggest that the first call or text rarely results in financial fraud; it is after the first communication that scammers start to create a relationship of trust to further gain access to sensitive information.\nLiaBraaten adds that “They’re building more and more details about the persona and when they gather enough information, then yes, they’re going to try to access your crypto wallet.”\nPeople who do not understand cryptocurrency are another group that is vulnerable to such attacks. It is unlikely that people who understand the technology and are crypto-savvy will become victims of Robocallers and other fraudulent practices.\nSo How Can One Avoid Falling Prey To Rising Crypto Scams?\nRegardless of having the ability to understand how scams work, users should be cautious about such calls and messages that seek personal and sensitive information.\nPeople who don’t understand how crypto works should avoid responding to prompts that ask for passwords and other information. They should only interact with official channels when absolutely necessary. This is an effective way of steering clear of Robocallers.\nLia Braaten further states:\nOne of the worst things that you can do is stay on the phone with these guys because it is their mission to relieve you of your cryptocurrency. It just takes a vulnerable moment, one minute of second-guessing yourself, and then they’re off to the races."}, {"date": "2022-12-27 15:31:00", "entity": ["l2 optimism kovan", "testnet", "whitepaper", "valhalla", "# floki", "valhalla", "optimism open world!", "valhalla", "floki", "valhalla", "shib army", "u", "floki", "shiba inu", "shib army", "shiba inu", "meme coin", "shiba inu", "shiba ete", "shib floki inu", "valhalla", "floki twitter", "realflokiinu", "valhalla", "twitter valhalla", "floki meme", "coin", "shib", "valhalla"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "SHIB rival Floki Inu has launched its first metaverse game called Valhalla to increase FLOKI utility and demand\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

As the applications indicate, Fidelity plans to serve its clients in a crypto-powered metaverse.\nFidelity filed three patent applications on Dec. 21 related to Web3 products and services, including an NFT marketplace and a crypto trading platform in the metaverse.\nFurther, the patent applications include a recommendation service for investment advice and financial planning in the metaverse. Fidelity aims to provide information in the metaverse about virtual real estate investing, as well as crypto trading and exchange services, charitable fundraising services, life insurance and annuities, as well as retirement and stock purchase plans.\nNotably, the applications also target investment services for mutual funds and pension funds in the metaverse. However, as usual, the patents are very general. Accordingly, there is no mention of whether the investment giant is targeting existing metaverses, and if so, which ones.\nIt is therefore questionable whether Fidelity is following other industry giants such as JP Morgan, which opened a virtual lounge in Decentraland in February to promote its proprietary blockchain network Onyx. In contrast, the Union Bank of India chose The Sandbox to host a Metaverse hangout in July.\nFidelity Is Bullish On Crypto\nRemarkably, Fidelity defied the bear market this year and used the time for its crypto expansion. In addition to its recent patents, Fidelity has been very bullish on the crypto industry throughout the year.\nAfter offering only a Bitcoin investment vehicle for a long time, Fidelity Digital Assets launched its Ethereum Index Fund in October. A month ago, Fidelity announced a crypto platform for its retail clients, where customers can buy and sell Bitcoin and Ether without paying a commission after opening a brokerage account with Fidelity.\nWhile facing regulatory headwinds in the U.S., Fidelity also began offering the option to invest retirement funds in cryptocurrencies in April. About 24,500 401(k) plans managed by Fidelity Investments began offering Bitcoin this fall. Employees can invest up to 20% of their 401(k) savings in Bitcoin, though their employers can set lower caps.\nAt press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $18,817, trading sideways in a very narrow price span for the last six days.\nFeatured image from Pensions & Investments, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-27 15:00:04", "entity": ["nft", "donkey college", "pessimistic donkey college", "nft", "del", "tt", "donkey college", "nft", "pessimistic donkey college"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "New York, United States, 27th December, 2022, Chainwire\nWith sales of non-fungible tokens falling for the 6th straight month, and falling by 60% in just Q3 to Q4 this year, it’s understandable to say the market is feeling pessimistic.

Volatility collapsed in October 2018 before surging again when Bitcoin dropped to the low point of $3,200 in December 2018, which was the last stage of the previous bear market.\nBitcoin volatility is the degree of variation in the price of Bitcoin over time. It reflects how much the price has changed over a certain period, usually measured by calculating the standard deviation of logarithmic returns. High volatility indicates that there is significant risk associated with investing in Bitcoin.\nThe most commonly used measure of Bitcoin volatility is the rolling 30-day annualized standard deviation of daily logarithmic returns, which ranges from 0 to 1.

There are two relevant indicators here, the miner supply and the miner outflow. The first of these, the miner supply, is simply a measure of the total amount of Bitcoin currently sitting in the wallets of miners.\nThe other one, the miner outflow, is a metric that keeps track of the total number of coins that miners are transferring out of their supply at the moment. Now, the “miner selling power” is defined as this miner outflow divided by the miner supply (30-day moving average, log-scaled).\nWhen the value of this indicator is high, it means miners are transferring out large amounts compared to their total supply right now. Since miners usually take out their BTC for dumping purposes, this trend can be bearish for the value of the crypto. On the other hand, low values suggest miners are spending relatively little amounts currently.\nThe below chart shows the trend in the Bitcoin miner selling power over the last few years:\nThe value of the metric seems to have taken a plunge in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\nAs the above graph displays, whenever the Bitcoin miner selling power has reached high values and set a local peak, the price of the crypto has seen some downtrend. This trend makes sense as highs in the metric suggest increased selling pressure from these chain validators.\nRecently, the indicator again showed such a formation, and BTC reacted with a decline this time as well, as its price went from more than $18,000 to the current $16,000 level. However, since this recent peak, the miner selling power has been rapidly going down and has now set a new low.\nThis muted selling pressure from miners may not necessarily be bullish by itself, but it does mean that if Bitcoin shows any bullish momentum now, miners wouldn’t provide any impedance to it for the time being.\nAn interesting long-term trend to notice in the miner selling power chart is that the metric has been on an overall downtrend in the last five years or so. This means that over time, miners have been selling lesser and lesser BTC compared to their reserves, suggesting that they have been accumulating and growing their supply instead.\nBTC Price\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16,800, up 1% in the last week.\nBTC continues to display boring price action | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Jievani Weerasinghe on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-27 14:30:05", "entity": ["cardano", "cardano", "polkadot", "santiment", "ada", "github", "github", "santiment", "cardano", "polkadot", "kusama", "cosmos", "ethereum", "coin", "cardano", "ada", "cardano", "unspla tradingview. com", "santiment. net", "santiment"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Data shows Cardano is still at the top of the developer activity list, despite the crypto’s price not having the best of times recently.\nCardano Remains First Ahead Of Polkadot In Dev Activity List\nAs per data from the analytics firm Santiment, ADA is still the top coin in the market in terms of developer activity. The “developer activity” here is measured using the amount of work that’s being done on the crypto’s public GitHub repositories.\nSome trackers gauge the activity using the total number of commits on the GitHub repository, but this approach may not be entirely accurate as forks of any project (basically a copy of the entire code) will also contain the same number of commits as the original, despite the second developer not being responsible for any of that work.\nBecause of this reason, Santiment’s indicator doesn’t count the commits, but rather the number of GitHub events on the repository. An event can occur through multiple actions on the project, like pushing a commit, creating an issue, and forking a repository.\nWith this methodology, things like forks are only counted as a single new event, and thus a more accurate representation of the real developer activity can be seen. Here is a table that shows the top cryptocurrencies in the market based on the amount of work being done on their respective projects:\nThe six most active projects in the cryptocurrency sector | Source: Santiment\nAs the above data displays, Cardano’s 30-day developer activity is the highest in the market, seeing around 444.1 events on average. The next most active project is Polkadot (DOT), with the metric’s value standing at 409.7 events.\nKusama (KSM), Cosmos (ATOM), and Decentraland (MANA) follow in 3rd, 4th, and 5th, respectively. Interestingly, Ethereum‘s developer activity is currently only the 6th highest, despite having the second-largest market cap in the sector.\nGenerally, high developer activity is a sign of commitment from the devs on the project and could serve as an indication of the long-term potential of the coin. While Cardano hasn’t performed that well in terms of the price recently, the crypto has still been the king in terms of developer activity for a while now. This commitment from the devs could be a positive signal for ADA investors and may reflect on the price in the coming year.\nADA Price\nAt the time of writing, Cardano’s price floats around $0.26, up 1% in the last week.\nThe value of the asset seems to have seen some rise in the last couple of days | Source: ADAUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Traxer on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, Santiment.net"}, {"date": "2022-12-27 14:27:52", "entity": ["financial services agency"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "Japan Plans to Allow Local Listing of 'Foreign' Stablecoins Such as USDT and USDC: Nikkei\nThe Financial Services Agency is seeking feedback on new stablecoin regulations set to take effect in 2023.\nBy Sandali Handagama Dec 27, 2022 at 2:27 p.m. UTC"}, {"date": "2022-12-27 14:25:22", "entity": ["rsi", "chz", "cmf", "chz", "fibonacci", "chiliz", "chiliz", "chz", "coinmarketcap", "chz", "chiliz chz", "chiliz", "chz", "##aritonov", "chz", "chiliz", "chz", "chz", "binance", "erc20", "ethereum", "chz", "tradingview. com", "chiliz", "chiliz", "traders union", "chiliz", "chiliz"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Chiliz (CHZ) looks bearish as it shaved off as much as 64% in 50 days.

The Shiba Inu community is currently eagerly anticipating its launch. Shibarium is a layer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu that targets Ethereum’s high transaction cost and low transaction speed problem.\nThe goal of the layer-2 blockchain is to lay the groundwork for building the Shiba Inu ecosystem, which will consist of a metaverse, a DEX, and blockchain games.

And what jurisdictions should respect their court orders?”\nWright then berated the Ripple CTO as ignorant when it comes to finance, legal issues, institutional investment banking, and Bitcoin in general. In addition, he further argued that it was impossible to have a logical debate with anyone involved with XRP and accused Schwartz of running a “useless pump-and-dump scheme.”\nWright also claimed that XRP actually only creates 100 TPS, not 1,500 TPS as advertised by Ripple: “The problem with any debate with anyone involved with XRP is that none of them can actually debate anything logically. David Schwartz should be able to provide logical answers. Yet, even the cult leader cannot do anything more than insults.”\nIn the aftermath, Schwartz called his counterpart a “despicable coward” who sues people for sharing his opinion. He added that Wright tries to back up his nonsensical claims with “irrelevant ad hominem.”\nFurthermore, Schwartz explained that he was just pointing out a dumb argument that Wright could not defend.\nCraig, anyone can see the thread. You made a very dumb argument. I pointed out it was dumb. You opted to raise completely irrelevant criticisms of me rather than defend your own indefensible nonsense. You’re now on a pathetic tirade of deflection. Defend your claim or abandon it.\nWright Wants To Support SEC In Lawsuit Against Ripple\nThe grand finale of the dispute was a threat by Wright that he will publish an “academic analysis” of XRP to a publication standard in 2023, which he will provide free of charge to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as support in its legal battle with Ripple.\n“Basically, we’re showing how dishonest the system is. Enjoy what’s coming. This will stop the constant XRP scams,” Wright wrote.\nA short time later, Wright followed up, accusing Ripple of not showing how its technology is used outside of paid trials.\nIf any Ripple product is implemented between banks the requirements are that these agreements are published within the frameworks for each of the organisations above. Where are the agreements with Ripple? It would seem that Ripple make literally hundreds of claims and yet no evidence of a single production system existing can be found.\nWright also claimed that one of Ripple’s biggest partners, SBI Holdings, is paid for marketing. “I’ve had dinner with Kitao-san on multiple occasions. No Ripple implementation has ever been produced. Rather, Ripple made an investment,” the self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor claimed.\nAs of press time, Schwartz had not yet addressed these allegations.

And don't forget: they're typically designed to be friendly to crypto newbies.\nIn the DeFi world, there are some green shoots, but the sector has to come a very long way before it can truly compete in the same arenas and in onboarding newcomers.\nSwapping assets\nInteroperability has had a brutal 2022. Some of the largest hacks that occurred this year were carried out on bridging services. Badger DAO suffered a $120 million exploit via an exploit to its front end, Wormhole fell to a $326 million attack on its cross-chain bridge, and PolyNetwork lost $611 million for similar reasons.\nNot all bridges are built alike, though, and so there’s certainly hope that a robust design will emerge. Hop Protocol is one such example, but it’s limited to Ethereum, Gnosis, and layer-2 solutions. Synapse is another popular cross-chain protocol that connects layer-1 and layer-2 networks. These are just examples, of course, and a bridge is only as trustworthy as its last attack.\nAD\nAD\nAlternatively, THORchain is also working on cross-chain swaps that leverage a slightly different design.\nStill, it is currently not nearly as simple to swap non-compatible assets in DeFi as it is on a centralized exchange. And for the normies in the audience, that’s going to remain a huge issue.\nMake it snappy\nLayer-2 solutions are going to play a key role in assisting non-custodial markets emerge for the masses. It’s quiet around crypto these days, and gas fees are at record lows, but don’t forget: with every bull market or catastrophe, those fees rise a ton.\nThe below chart shows average gas fees for since this time last year. As the bull market dwindled, so too did these fees. But can you guess when Terra imploded?\nGas fees from December 27, 2021 to December 27, 2022. Image: Etherscan.\nFortunately, layer-2 adoption is happening in a big way.\nMeasured across values such as how many users are moving from Ethereum to these solutions and how many transactions are happening, the market is growing quickly.\nThere are over 516,000 different addresses that have moved funds to zkSync, for example. The largest total amount moved between Ethereum to Arbitrum has been 2.08 million ETH, according to Dune Analytics.\nThe below chart makes this trend a little clearer. If layer-2 solutions were nearly nonexistent this time last year, users are making far more transactions on Optimism and Arbitrum than ever before. And that's only measuring two of the market's products.\nTransaction count on Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Optimism over the past year. Image: Dune.\nShow me the money\nThe final component here is being able to do any of these actions without needing a trusted intermediary.\nYes, many are fortunate to have access to reasonable banking services from the start, but removing the exchange from the bank-to-exchange-to-smart- contracts equation is a key step in a world where exchanges can implode seemingly overnight.\nAD\nAD\nConsider Uniswap’s recent fiat on-ramp launch. Now, when you head over to the decentralized exchange, you can select to use a bank transfer, credit or debit card to buy crypto. Once bought, the crypto is sent directly to a non-custodial wallet of your choice, be that a Ledger hardware solution or your browser wallet.\nThe solution, powered by MoonPay, is also available on layer-2 networks like Optimism and Arbitrum, so you can move directly over to those speedy layers, too.\nConcluding: next year will offer tons of business opportunities for crafty entrepreneurs who find unique ways to tackle each of these problems—or more than one of them at the same time.\nAs former Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale said, “There are only two ways to make money in business: bundling and unbundling.”\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay.

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of December 2022, it has over 130 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.4 billion total transactions, and over $9.3 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\nTRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum\nContact\nHayward Wong"}, {"date": "2022-12-27 11:00:35", "entity": ["moritz knoringer", "tradingview. com", "nfts", "ftx", "american exchange", "coinbase", "bitcoin", "coinbase", "mt gox", "darma", "bitcoin", "btc", "altcoins", "ethereum", "darma capital", "digital asset risk management advisor", "u. s. federal reserve", "shanghai hard fork", "darma", "lido finance", "obol network", "darma", "arbitrum", "eos", "cardano", "ethereum", "coinbase", "darma capital", "cumberland", "coinbase", "cumberland drw llc", "isdas & csas", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "matic", "looks", "xmon", "gamefi", "ethereum", "coinbase", "ethereum", "coinbase", "ethereum", "ethereum", "coinbase", "eth", "binance smart chain", "bsc", "tvl", "polygon", "optimism", "arbitrum", "coinbase", "nfts", "ethereum", "coinbase", "eth", "u. s. exchange", "shanghai hard fork", "darma capital", "eth", "bitcoin", "coinbase", "darma capital", "ethereum"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "No less than three renowned crypto institutions have recently given their predictions for the coming year 2023 – and there seems to be one favorite: Ethereum. Other main themes for Coinbase, Darma Capital, and Cumberland include the migration of investors to quality projects, the burgeoning innovation from creative destruction, and some fundamental reforms for the crypto industry as a whole.\nThe largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, estimates that crypto markets will not yet decouple from traditional financial markets in early 2023, with investors focusing on quality projects with sustainable tokenomics and mature ecosystems with liquidity.\nCoinbase Predicts Ethereum Ecosystem To Flourish\nCoinbase also predicts that the market for layer-1 competitors to Ethereum is oversaturated and that the coming year could be the year of layer-2 blockchains. Thus, Ethereum’s competitors will have a tough time, according to Coinbase. While ETH and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) will hold up well, TVL will migrate to layer 2 solutions such as Polygon, Optimism, and Arbitrum.\nCoinbase also predicts another boom for NFTs, which will see an evolution to integration with personalized IDs, ticketing, subscriptions, real-world assets (RWA) tokenization, and supply chain logistics. In addition, more companies will integrate NFTs for brand building and customer engagement.\nAs a result of human error in the demise of FTX and other projects in 2022, the American exchange expects regulatory clarity to be critical to the next cycle. Perhaps surprisingly, to some, Coinbase also says institutional lending will sprout and flourish in 2023 with improved due diligence processes – once the bottom is reached.\nAs for the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Bitcoin, Coinbase predicts that Mt Gox distribution will not be the big event in 2023, as some analysts claim. Those who wanted to sell have already sold. Moreover, the distributions will be staggered.\nWith regards to Ethereum, Coinbase shares a bullish outlook due to the Merge. ETH is able to be more efficient as a result of the move to proof of stake and is also deflationary. Moreover, the U.S. exchange predicts that the amount of liquid ETH will continue to decline once withdrawals from the deposit contract are possible after the Shanghai hard fork.\nDarma Capital Predicts ETH To Outperform Bitcoin\nJust like Coinbase, Darma Capital views the Ethereum Merge as a key development that will have a positive impact on the ETH price. The same goes for the Shanghai hard fork, which will lead to increased ETH staking.\nOn a technical level, Darma sees proto-danksharding as a game-changer for ETH, while it expects innovations from Lido Finance and Obol Network. Fundamentally, Darma predicts that L2s will be key to adoption by the next wave of consumer-facing applications, mentioning Arbitrum, Optimism, and Immutable.\n“Vaporwave Chains” like EOS and Cardano will die out as they lose mainstream interest due to lack of on-chain adoption, Darma says.\nThe forecast for Bitcoin is not rosy either. According to the institution, BTC will lose market share to altcoins while Ethereum will accomplish the “flippening.” Responsible for this, according to Darma Capital, could be a lack of utility, ESG concerns, and a “failure as a digital gold.”\nIn general, the digital asset risk management advisor expects that the macroeconomic situation will result in a freeze on interest rate hikes by the U.S. Federal Reserve until the second quarter of 2023. Consequently, the crypto market will see another bull run in Q3 2023.\nThree Emerging Narratives\nCumberland DRW LLC expects challenging market conditions and clear regulatory frameworks in 2023 that will lead to innovative solutions. With this in mind, retail investors will focus on exchanges that can score with transparency, spot trading without prefunding, ISDAs & CSAs, the institution says.\nAs three emerging narratives, the company identifies Bitcoin and Ethereum as reserve currencies, NFTs for IP tokenization, loyalty programs, and customer engagement, specifically citing MATIC, LOOKS, XMON, and GameFi.\nAt press time, the Ethereum (ETH) price stood at $1,218.\nFeatured image from Moritz Knoringer / Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-27 10:52:00", "entity": ["santiment", "cardano", "cardano", "polkadot", "kusama", "decentraland", "cosmos", "ethereum", "cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "opencnft", "cardano - rosetta", "plutus", "lace", "lace wallet", "adrestia", "cardano", "cardano", "plutus", "mithril", "obsidian systems", "cardano", "builder iog", "obsidian systems", "hydra", "hydra", "hydra", "hydra"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

What is in store for the freedom currency?\nThe man, woman, or group of people that went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto minted the Bitcoin genesis block on January 3, 2009. In that first block, Nakamoto wrote the following headline from the Times newspaper: “Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”.\nSuch a headline being written into the genesis block of the fastest growing asset in history really puts into perspective as to ‘why’ Satoshi Nakamoto spent the time on engineering something that might provide a liferaft out of the poverty-inducing monetary system that persists to this day.\nThe monetary system makes the world go round, and yet nobody really questions how currency comes into existence. It’s not taught at schools, and even probably the vast majority of individuals who work in banks or financial agencies don’t have a clue as to how our debt-based monetary system actually works.\nThe renowned industrialist Henry Ford said:\n“It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.”\nThe noble venture that is Bitcoin was probably allowed to flourish because those in the banking system initially ignored it, and then they laughed at it. However, the laughing went on long enough for Bitcoin to gain the network strength through decentralised nodes, that allowed it to become the securest computing network on earth.\nSome attribute the saying to Gandhi in his struggle for Indian independence from the British “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.”\nBitcoin is in the fighting phase right now. The bankers and those that lead the world’s financial agencies have realised to their horror that Bitcoin has become a force to be reckoned with.\nNow the full force of the ‘system’ can be brought to bear on the Bitcoin network. A fight to the death of either of the systems has now been initiated, and only the future will tell us if the decentralised Bitcoin network will be able to withstand the tsunami of misdirection from the mainstream media, and the crushing weight of regulation that will seek to grind the cryptocurrency sector into the dust.\nThe fear is that control over the minds of the populace will give the central banks the time they need in which to roll out their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). And of course, once these are embedded across the world, liberty and freedom can be crushed once and for all.\nTo quote former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair: “Education, education, education.”\nWe live in a world where mainstream news generally always carries a particular slant, and where television and social media is full of inanities that lull us all into mind-numbing indifference.

Unlike Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), with a weekly upshot of 0.40% and 1.40% respectively, XRP is up by 7.13% within the same time span.\nThe coin’s metrics are up in unison as its 24-hour trading volume went up by 143.81% to $947.9 million. Its figures back its seven-day high of $0.3691 as it leads the altcoin’s growth today.\nXRP is beaten but not battered\nXRP has had a rather tumultuous year, particularly with the fact that it was at the center of the legal brawl between its affiliated blockchain payments firm, Ripple Labs Inc, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nWhile the regulator alleged that Ripple sold the XRP coin as an unregistered security in the $1.3 billion lawsuit filed in December 2020, the company is arguing that its use of the cryptocurrency is as a payment token.\nAt the moment, XRP holders and investors are generally unfazed by the ongoing lawsuit. This is because many experts believe Ripple is on track to get a favorable verdict as the key timelines in the case show the end is in sight. The community’s commitment was, however, tested over the past few days by the spat between Ripple CTO David Schwartz and self-proclaimed Bitcoin inventor Craig Wright.\nAs U.Today reported earlier, Wright called XRP “the most useless pump and dump scheme” in the blockchain space. This comment is capable of derailing the growth momentum of the digital currency, and its growth can be likened to the XRP community’s way of saying the coin is not a pump-and-dump token as alleged."}, {"date": "2022-12-27 09:42:00", "entity": ["bitcoin", "glassnode", "bitcoin", "btc", "bitcoin", "ftx", "stablecoins"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "Bitcoin keeps outflowing from exchanges by hundreds of millions of dollars\nAccording to Glassnode, the equivalent of $265.6 million worth of Bitcoin has been withdrawn from centralized exchanges in the past 24 hours, with a net outflow of $43.1 million.\nAt the same time, yesterday was just another day in an ongoing stream of BTC withdrawals from exchanges and transfers to decentralized solutions.

The network's Fusion upgrade seeks to provide crypto investors with dependable, safe and profitable exchanges at a lowered cost.\nThe update to 1inch is designed to maximize revenue potential, safeguard users' funds, and provide a seamless user experience in the decentralized finance sector. 1inch's Swap Engine connects DeFi users and provides liquidity for crypto trades with the use of professional market makers, operating as a decentralized trading and matching backend system.\n“Fusion makes swaps on 1inch dramatically more cost-efficient, as users won’t have to pay network fees, plus, an extra layer of security is added, protecting users from sandwich attacks,\" shares Sergej Kunz, 1inch Network co-founder.\nTaking a revolutionary step away from the standard centralized system, 1inch's latest upgrade affords investors to securely make noncustodial swaps without needing permission or trusting any third-party. These transactions occur in an entirely trustless and autonomous manner.\nAs announced, 1inch is providing seemingly endless liquidity and utilizing a cutting-edge decentralized order-matching approach modeled on the Dutch auction model. The Dutch auction model proceeds by determining a ceiling price for an asset, starting at its higher level, and then gradually lowering until bidders are willing or able to accept the current price. This approach allows DeFi users to find the best rates when making transactions on 1inch.\n1inch's new Fusion mode enables users to trade tokens across decentralized exchanges (DEXs) without incurring any network fees. The improved version also grants users the autonomy to decide when their order should be executed based on their individual requirements.\nIn addition, the Fusion mode ensures protection against MEV (Maximum Extractable Value), which is indicated as the maximum amount which can be harvested from block production outside and in excess of regular gas fee and reward.\n1inch's Fusion upgrade also comes with the introduction of its Resolver Incentive Program, a new system that provides resolvers with a refund on the gas spent for filling orders in Fusion mode. However, 1inch has noted that this will only be applicable until the 31st of December this year.\n\"As resolvers will fill orders without trying to minimize their gas costs, they will offer better swap rates to users. As a result, regular users will be the main beneficiaries of the program.\" 1inch clarified in a blog post.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The hash rate had fallen from a weekly peak of 276.40 EH/s.\nThe drop was attributed to bone-chilling temperatures across the United States of America that stretched the country’s electricity grid.\nChristmas Chill Cripples Mining Operations\nThe week leading up to Christmas saw a monster storm wreak havoc as the cold arctic chill swept across the United States, crippling the energy grid and leaving millions without power. The freezing temperatures also claimed 28 lives. Bitcoin mining operations were also severely impacted, with the energy grid stretched thin. According to reports, Bitcoin miners in Texas, which account for a significant chunk of the country’s hash rate, voluntarily ceased operations, giving power back to the grid and allowing residents to keep their homes heated.\nThe disruption caused due to the mining operations had a significant impact on Bitcoin’s hashrate. Typically, the hash rate stays between 225 and 300 Exhashes per second (EH/s). On the 25th of December, this number dropped to 170.60 EH/s. However, the hashrate rose to 241.29 EH/s, according to data sourced by hash rate mining calculator CoinWarz.\nCommunity Debates Cause Of Drop\nBitcoin’s hash rate is calculated by measuring the hashes produced by Bitcoin miners when they are solving the subsequent block. The hash rate is considered a key metric for assessing the Bitcoin network’s security. The drop in hash rate prompted John Stefanop, FutureBit founder, to issue a controversial statement blaming highly centralized mining operations in Texas for switching off at the same time for the drop. Stefanop stated,\n“I know, does not change the fact that a few large mines in Texas affect the entire network to the tune of 33%... everyone’s transactions are now being confirmed 30% slower because the hash rate is not decentralized enough. If hash rate was distributed evenly around the world by 10’s of millions of small miners instead of a few dozen massive mines, this event would not have even registered on the network.”\nHowever, Bitcoin bull Dan Held countered the argument, stating that weather patterns and their impact on operations does not equal centralized operations or ownership.\nBitcoin Continues To “Work Perfectly”\nDespite the weather and the numerous issues it caused, the Bitcoin network continued to function normally. This was pointed out by the CEO of the Bitcoin mining advocacy group, Satoshi Action Fund, Dennis Porter, in a Twitter post. Porter stated,\n“Over 30% of the #Bitcoin hash rate has gone offline due to extreme weather in Texas, and yet the global #Bitcoin network continues to work perfectly. Now imagine if Amazon or Google tried turning off 1/3rd of their data centers.”\nBurgeoning Hash Rate\nCurrently, the United States is the biggest contributor to the Bitcoin hash rate. According to the Cambridge Electricity consumption Index, the United States currently accounts for over 37% of the monthly hash rate share. All of the top states for Bitcoin mining, Georgia, Kentucky, New York, and Texas, experienced significant power outages due to the massive snowstorm.\nTexas, in particular, has seen a significant Bitcoin mining boom in recent months thanks to favorable regulations. This has seen some of the biggest mining companies set up operations in the state. These include Argo, Rion blockchain, Bitdeer, Compute North, core Scientific, and Genesis Digital Assets.\nHowever, the recent events have contributed to a growing list of headaches for mining companies. The ongoing bear market has resulted in mining companies accruing debt to the tune of $4 billion. Additionally, several prominent US-based mining companies have recently filed for bankruptcy. However, the recent events don’t seem to have had an impact on Bitcoin’s price so far.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The plaintiffs recorded and documented their dealings on the crypto exchange, showing Binance's marketing materials for its French users. According to the plaintiffs, these were done right before Binance gained authorized registry with local regulatory bodies.\nThe lawsuit was filed on December 14, formalizing complaints against Binance France which included allegations of securities law violations for the sale of TerraUSD and its sister cryptocurrency Terra (LUNC). The lawsuit claims that Binance was selling these digital assets in violation of law, and buyers were not warned or sufficiently informed, through advertising materials, about the risks involved in their purchases.\nThe lawsuit outlines Binance's unlawful sale of the highly debated algorithmic stablecoin and other tokens without informing buyers regarding potential risks. In their complaint, the plaintiffs assert that Binance and its senior management were aware of the downfall of a project prior to marketing it globally. Consequently, they have allegedly lost over 2.4 million euros due to believing in false claims that this token was backed by US dollars.\nInvestors who relied on Binance to purchase UST were sorely disappointed, as they quickly found out that the exchange was far from 'safe,' 'stable,' and/or 'fiat-backed.' Furthermore, French investors have expressed their grievances in claiming that Binance acted more like an \"actual seller\" when it came to any transactions taking place on its platform; rather than simply facilitating a direct exchange between those parties involved, it went so far as to actually credit or debit each individual's respective accounts.\nUpon inquiry, Binance France declared that they had not been notified of any civil or criminal proceedings. Additionally, the entity confirmed that no promotional activities were undertaken in France prior to receiving registration from French authorities.\n“Binance did not promote in France before being allowed to do so. Telegram groups are global community forums, which any Telegram user can create or join voluntarily,” Binance stated.\nIt was only earlier in May this year that Binance France was able to secure a digital asset service provider with the country's regulators. The license provides the exchange as a Paris-based business to provide traders with a premier cryptocurrency platform while also serving as a custodian for businesses linked to crypto. This, despite the fact that Binance has faced immense regulatory pressure from UK and other European authorities this year, it is still determined to expand into Europe.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As different users had variable proportions of assets and debt, this process might take a little [time],\" Defrost Finance devs stated through an official blog post.\nAccording to the team, the first attack involved the use of a flash loan sequence to drain funds from its V2 product. Another exploit was launched using the owner key, gaining access to Defrost Finance's V1 product.\nIn decentralized finance protocols, liquidations occur when the value of a user's collateral falls below a protocol's minimum loan-to-value ratio. Defrost allows users to deposit collateral for a loan, which the protocol uses to calculate the interest rate on that loan. Fake collateral introduced into V2 likely compromised users' loan-to-value ratios, leading to their liquidations.\nThe protocol is built on top of the Avalanche blockchain. What's curious is that blockchain security firms such as Peckshield have claimed that the attack was more of an inside job, and has been considered a rug pull.\nCertiK, another blockchain security and auditing firm, confirmed that they have been unable to establish contact with the Defrost Finance team, leading to the firm posting a warning on its Twitter account which indicated that the Defrost Finance hack was instead an exit scam. At the time of writing, Defrost Finance's official Twitter account could is either not able to receive message or is already pre-configured not to do so.\nIn November 2021, CertiK audited Defrost V1's smart contracts and listed a critical logic issue and five issues relating to centralization. Both issues were resolved at press time; the former was acknowledged without evidence of further work, while the latter was acknowledged with evidence of further work.\nThe term \"bug\" refers to a logic issue, which can cause smart contracts to operate incorrectly without crashing. Logic issues occur when smart contracts fail to work as intended, whereas centralization issues are a result of a hacker gaining access to shared code blocks or variables.\nInitial reports on the exploit revealed that roughly $173,000 was drained through the V1 protocol, while another $1.4 million was taken through Rubic Finance, a cross-chain aggregator linked with Defrost Finance. These, along with the $12 million heist on its V2 product, have raised concerns about the protocol's stability and security in terms of its smart contract code, putting into question the issue of centralization across its ecosystem.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Where such an exchange not listing a high-ranking digital asset such as ADA would usually draw criticism, Hoskinson does not seem to mind this and instead welcomes it.\nNo Need To Be On Gemini\nGemini crypto exchange is one of the large exchanges that are yet to have Cardano for trading on its platform. The exchange which currently lists more than 110 coins, the majority of those being assets with a lower market cap than Cardano, has dragged its feet on listing ADA but founder Charles Hoskinson is not stressing it.\nJumping on a Twitter Space that was held on Sunday with his brother William, Hoskinson told his over 9,000 listeners that the digital asset was not being listed on the Gemini crypto exchange. Now, recall that Gemini had run into trouble with its Earn program when Genesis Digital Trading had paused withdrawals and was said to be at risk of bankruptcy. Gemini, in turn, had to pause its Earn program and Genesis now reportedly owes the exchange $900 million in user assets.\nHoskinson compares this to FTX, which had also not listed ADA for trading. FTX had planned to list the cryptocurrency about a month before it collapsed, which means no ADA coins were lost when the exchange filed for bankruptcy.\n“We are still not listed on Gemini,” Hoskinson stated. “Turns out that’s probably a good thing cause FTX didn’t list us either.”\nADA Maintains Dominance\nDespite being treated like an afterthought by a number of large exchanges in the past, Cardano still maintains its position as one of the most dominant cryptocurrencies in the market. With a market cap of more than $8.9 billion, it is currently the ninth-largest cryptocurrency, and this is in spite of the token losing a large chunk of its value.\nADA struggles at $0.26 | Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com\nIn 2021, ADA hit an all-time high price of $3.10, but since then, it has lost more than 91% of its value. This makes it one of the top losers of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. It is now consolidation between the $0.24 and $0.26 price ranges with no sign of a breakout on the horizon.\nThere is still major resistance at the $0.0265 level which is where bears had made their stand during Friday’s rally. For ADA to see gains before the end of the year, it would need to break and establish support above $0.265, otherwise, a low finish will be the most likely scenario.\nADA is trending at $0.26 at the time of this writing. It is up 0.84% in the last 24 hours and down 1.39% in the last 7 days.\nFeatured image from Data Driven Investor, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-26 20:44:27", "entity": ["fidelity", "fidelity", "metaverse", "metaverse investment services", "fidelity", "bitcoin", "metaverse", "fidelity", "fidelity investments", "fidelity", "fidelity digital", "bitcoin", "fidelity"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Fidelity's foray into the world of NFTs signals a renewed interest from traditional finance companies in exploring various sectors of Web3\nAfter successfully introducing the world of cryptocurrency investing to its customer base, Fidelity is now exploring more possibilities in the metaverse.\nAccording to trademark attorney Mike Kondoudis, the company has just filed a series of trademark applications covering non-fungible tokens (NFTs), marketplaces for NFTs, metaverse investment services, virtual real estate investing, and even cryptocurrency trading.\nConsidering that Fidelity was one of the first major financial companies to recognize and adopt Bitcoin, it is not surprising that they are now exploring more options for their customers within the metaverse.\nDespite the ongoing crypto winter, Fidelity keeps pushing deeper into crypto.

It sold for just under $20,000 worth of ETH.\nAkutars get locked up\nHere’s a very painful reminder of why you can’t be too careful with coding smart contracts, which hold the code that powers NFT projects and autonomous decentralized apps. In April 2022, artist and former MLB player Micah Johnson launched his Akutars project, taking in tens of millions of dollars’ worth of ETH during the mint. And then it all went sour.\nSoon after launch, exploits were spotted and triggered by unknown attackers, permanently locking the contract with all funds inside of it. Some $34 million worth of ETH (at the time) is now forever stuck in the smart contract, inaccessible by the creators or NFT buyers. Johnson vowed to persevere, relaunching with a new contract and refunding buyers who were due funds.\nBored Ape sells for $115\nEarlier this year, it was common to see Bored Ape NFTs sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of ETH—so when one sold for just $115, it was a total shock. This isn’t the first time or last that we’ve seen a blue chip NFT sell for a fraction of what it’s worth, but this was one of the more prominent examples from this year.\nIt’s still unclear exactly what happened, but the seller accepted an offer of 115 DAI, a dollar-pegged stablecoin. Some theorize that the seller mistook it for a 115 ETH bid, which would’ve been in the right ballpark of value (Apes started at 106.8 ETH, or $358,000 at the time). Others think it was intentional tax harvesting, perhaps designed to look like a mistake. A Mutant Ape was sold in tandem for $25 worth of DAI, only amplifying the (potential) losses.\nFTX NFTs are stuck\nTo some, FTX’s entry into the NFT space in late 2021 felt like another legitimizing moment for the nascent market. A year later, amid the cryptocurrency exchange’s very public collapse and criminal charges for founder Sam Bankman-Fried, it has turned into another example of what not to do with NFT marketplace infrastructure.\nFTX onboarded major brands into the NFT space, including concert festivals Coachella and Tomorrowland and Formula One team Mercedes-AMG Petronas, but now many of those branded assets are stuck on the marketplace amid bankruptcy proceedings. Other NFTs that users withdrew into self-custody wallets are no longer working properly, as the imagery is stored on FTX servers. It’s another red flag for marketplaces that take or keep custody of users’ NFTs.\nPixelmon’s reveal\nAt the peak of the NFT frenzy earlier this year, nearly anything with a little buzz around it could sell out and generate massive sums of cash in the process. One unfortunate example is Pixelmon, a clear-cut Pokémon knockoff with NFTs that clearly didn’t have much behind it.\nAfter raising $70 million by selling monster NFTs, the artwork for those creatures was revealed—and it was terrible. Even the founder called the reveal a “horrible mistake.” A new team acquired the rights, launched more refined artwork, and is building a game around the NFTs. But they now trade for a fraction of the original mint price.\nCoinbase rethinks Bored Ape films\nAt the height of the Bored Ape frenzy in April, Coinbase announced plans to create a short film trilogy based on the NFTs, even featuring Apes owned by community members. But when the first short rolled out in July amid a much weaker market, it was widely panned by viewers, who criticized the lack of Apes and awkward timing following significant Coinbase layoffs.\nAD\nAD\nAfter that, it was radio silence until Coinbase confirmed to Decrypt in December that it opted to “pause production” on the remaining chapters. The firm’s statement left the window open for an eventual revival, but given the state of the NFT and crypto markets, we’d be surprised. Echoing recent comments from noted NFT artist Emily “pplpleasr” Yang, there’s a lot of money for Web3 video content, but not a lot of great stuff just yet.\nAurory’s FTX NFTs hit different\nWhen FTX teamed up with Solana NFT game Aurory and esports giant Team SoloMid (TSM) to launch limited-edition NFTs in October 2021, the collaboration made a huge splash, with one of the auctioned NFTs even benefiting charity. But after the exchange’s downfall, the massive sums paid for some of the NFTs surely feels a lot different now.\nIn November, pseudonymous NFT collector Bardstocks tweeted, “380K USD down the drain” while sharing images of two of the Aurory PFPs with FTX apparel. “I was so excited to get these,” they added, lamenting the firm’s implosion. They are technically limited edition NFTs, but the FTX name doesn’t make quite the same impression today.\n380k USD down the drain. I was so excited to get these. I really believed FTX was going to be the Amazon of Crypto. They were just dramatically changing the expectations of exchanges. No clear warning signs and trusted by many.

The “transaction count (total)” is an indicator that measures the total number of transfers taking place on the Ethereum blockchain on any given day.\nWhen the value of this metric is high, it means traders are active on the network right now. On the other hand, low values imply the chain is seeing low activity at the moment. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) version of this indicator over the last couple of years:\nThe 30-day EMA value of the metric seems to have been constantly going down in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant\nAs shown in the above graph, the 30-day EMA Ethereum transaction count has been in a state of overall decline since May 2021, when ETH set its then all-time high. The indicator has, however, seen some periods of respite where the trend would temporarily reverse, and the metric would climb up before continuing back on the downward trajectory.\nThese bursts of activity coincided with local tops in the price of the crypto, a trend that makes sense as rallies usually require a large number of traders to be sustainable. Though, just like uptrends in the metric accompanied bullish momentum in the price of Ethereum, downtrends usually resulted in the crypto’s value also observing a bearish fate.\nMost recently, the 30-day EMA transaction count has once again seen a plummet, showing that the demand for the crypto is still absent from the market. And if recent patterns are anything to go by, this decline may lead to Ethereum plunging down soon as well.\nETH Price\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum’s price floats around $1,200, up 1% in the last week. Over the past month, the crypto has gained 1% in value.\nBelow is a chart that shows the trend in the price of the coin over the last five days.\nLooks like ETH has been at a standstill in the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\nEthereum has been locked in sideways movement for a while now, but it’s unclear when the crypto may escape from this consolidation.

In response, a person familiar with the matter tells Decrypt that any decision about Vauld's future, as Nexo sees it, is in the hands of the firm’s creditor committee, not its former CEO.\nRumors that negotiations had collapse were sparked by an email sent by Vauld founder and CEO Darshan Bathija to the firm's creditors, which said that discussions with Nexo “have unfortunately not come to fruition.”\nAD\nAD\nAfter halting withdrawals from its platform at the beginning of June, Vauld filed for protection against creditors and lawsuits in a Singapore court, with the move being very similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy of the U.S. bankruptcy code. Vauld reportedly owed a total of $402 million to its creditors, including the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX.\nNexo announced plans to acquire Vauld immediately after Vauld’s troubles came to light, with the two parties signing an exclusivity period, which, according to Nexo, is not over.\nIn order for the deal to be called off, according to to the person in the know, the terms of the exclusive talks require mutual agreement—which is also not the case.\n“Nexo has not given up on its attempt to save Vauld and help its creditors recover the maximum possible platform funds,” Nexo managing partner Kalin Metodiev told Decrypt.\nVauld creditors’ concerns\nToday, Nexo has also sent Vauld’s creditors an open letter and a final amended proposal for acquisition (a copy of which Decrypt has reviewed), saying that despite Nexo’s “genuine intention to help as promptly as possible,” the firm’s transaction team “faced daily challenges, such as receiving slow and incomprehensive financial and legal due diligence information and encountering bias from the process administrator, Kroll (Singapore).”\nDescribing the administrator’s actions, Nexo said Kroll “seemed to be directing the solution towards an active management arrangement rather than a lending arrangement, which would expose the former creditors to risk and require them to rely on aggressive return projections to recover their losses.”\n“As an industry leader we are disappointed to see a handful of people with self-serving agendas trying to highjack the narrative and bar the creditors from making their best decision,\" Metodiev told Decrypt. \"We were hoping that the bad actors have mostly departed the blockchain space, but it is obvious that, as a community, we still have work to do.\"\nVauld concerns reportedly include Nexo’s plans to gradually phase out the U.S. market, where the Singapore-based company has many clients. However, in today’s proposal, Nexo said it is intends to acquire Vauld’s customer base, all cryptocurrency owned by Vauld, and all cryptocurrency attributable to Vauld’s clients—as well as all liabilities arising out of the ownership of the acquired assets.\nAD\nAD\nNexo added that all customers—unless subject to restrictions in their respective jurisdictions’ regulatory framework—will be able to borrow, earn, and exchange against the digital assets allocated in their new accounts, effective immediately.\nAdditional measures include an injection of capital from Nexo’s balance sheet, effectively reducing the asset deficit by 10% to all new Nexo customers, and no lock-up period for asset withdrawals."}, {"date": "2022-12-26 17:45:58", "entity": ["stablecoin", "stablecoins", "stablecoin", "fsa", "stablecoin", "fsa", "stablecoins", "usdt", "usdc", "fsa", "stablecoin", "tether", "usd coin", "local news nikkei", "financial services agency of japan", "stablecoin", "stablecoin"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Japanese regulators are reconsidering lifting the ban on cryptocurrency restrictions related to foreign stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC) in 2023 according to reports by local news agencies.\nAccording to reports by local news agency Nikkei, the Financial Services Agency (FSA) of Japan is to reconsider major cryptocurrency strictions related to the distribution of foreign issued stablecoins in 2023.

Schiff continues to staunchly oppose the cryptocurrency which he believes holds no intrinsic value. His most recent advice to investors comes right on Christmas Day when the festivities have pulled the market into a lull.\nTime To Sell Bitcoin\nTaking to Twitter, Peter Schiff posted what he called his “Christmas gift” to bitcoin investors. The post followed the usual trend of bashing BTC, with a chart that he used to support his claim. The chart which shows the trend of the digital asset over the last six months pointed out that a support level had been turned into resistance.\nSchiff said the chart shows that “bitcoin is much closer to its ceiling than it is to its floor.” As such, he believes that there is little to no potential for the digital asset to make a recovery. Instead, he expects a decline and has advised investors to sell as it is the “Smart move.”\nMy #Christmas gift to #HODLers is this #Bitcoin chart. As you can see Bitcoin is much closer to its ceiling than its floor. The yellow line that was once support is now resistance. Since the upside potential is so low and downside risk so high, the smart move is to sell today. pic.twitter.com/lPOLABGEQQ — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 25, 2022\nAs expected, Schiff’s tweet was met with resistance from BTC investors. One of the top comments under the post was of a user who said that the economist telling people to sell was a “major buy signal from Peter Schiff.”\nAnother user posted a screenshot of one of Schiff’s tweets from 2018 where he warns that buying bitcoin at $3,800 was a bad idea. Three years after that tweet, BTC would reach its all-time high of $69,000, more than 15x the price Schiff warned investors not to purchase it.\nLook at Peter, giving out the Christmas presents!

Since the collapse of FTX, authorities have been ramping up their efforts to regulate the crypto industry to make it safer for investors but the economist thinks that all of this is in vain. Once again, Schiff asks investors to sell their cryptocurrencies because that’s the only way to stay safe.\nBTC sitting above $16,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\n“Many claim government needs to regulate #crypto so people can be confident that their money will be safe. There’s nothing government can do to make investing in crypto safe. The only safe thing you can do with crypto is sell it. But that just transfers your loss to someone else.”\nNevertheless, there have been calls for proper crypto regulation. The depot governor of the Bank of England (BoE) Sir Jon Cunliffe, told Sky News last week that the collapse of FTX shows that crypto is ‘too dangerous’ to remain unregulated. However, economist Stephen Cecchetti believes that legitimizing crypto with regulations would have adverse effects on the financial system.\nFeatured image from BeInCrypto, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-26 15:29:00", "entity": ["gillian keegan", "state for education", "twitter", "twitter", "tesla", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "twitter", "youtube"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Gillian Keegan, a British politician serving as Secretary of State for Education, was recently subject to a Twitter hack.\nHer account tweeted cryptocurrency-related messages and changed to the profile of controversial billionaire Elon Musk.\nThe tweets were about a bogus event supposedly hosted by Musk's companies (Twitter and Tesla).

Even the BTC hashrate has felt an impact from this winter storm. The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that measures the total amount of computing power currently connected to the Bitcoin network.\nWhen the value of this metric goes up, it means miners are bringing more machines online on the blockchain right now. Such a trend shows miners are finding the current network attractive to mine on. On the other hand, decreasing values of the indicator suggest some miners are disconnecting their rigs at the moment, possibly because they have been facing low or no mining profits on the chain.\nNow, here is a chart that shows how the 7-day moving average value of the Bitcoin hashrate has changed over the past year:\nThe 7-day MA value of the metric seems to have sharply dropped off recently | Source: Blockchain.com\nAs the above graph shows, the 7-day MA Bitcoin mining hashrate has observed a significant decline during the last couple of weeks. This drawdown was initially caused by a 3% increase in the mining difficulty (which caused some miners who were already on the verge of going underwater to ditch the network), but the fall has extended in the last few days due to the storm.\nThe reason these recent freezing temperatures have had an effect on the hashrate is that BTC mining companies in places like Texas, where the power grid was put under immense pressure, made the decision to switch off their rigs in order to divert energy back into the grid so that the residents could get constant heating in their homes.\n“Due to extreme cold weather sweeping across the eastern and southern half of the US, we will be participating in multiple power curtailments to help stabilize the electrical grid. BTC production is expected to decrease during this time,” tweeted Core Scientific, one of the biggest mining firms, on Friday.\nIt seems the disruptions may have now ended as the daily hashrate has spiked back, retreading the plunge.

With the total user base of cryptocurrencies spilling over the 290 million mark, it is easy to fathom that with such turbulence on the crypto market, users will be concerned with the safety of their assets. Online search engine queries are brimming with requests for the “best crypto wallet”, but in light of the collapse of the FTX exchange, users have started searching for non-custodial wallets en masse.\nIndeed, the need for a free of custody wallet is becoming acute as cryptocurrencies are entering the financial and commercial mainstream markets. And with the abundance of decentralized wallet options available on the market, the mind boggles of the possibilities. As such, we have compiled a list of the best non-custodial crypto wallets to answer the question of which crypto wallet is best for beginners.\nWhen it comes to crypto wallet app choices, few representatives of the non-custodial ilk can match the offering provided by NOW Wallet. This convenient and versatile product was released by the popular ChangeNOW exchange ChangeNOW, combining the best of its technological solutions and security measures that have been perfected by years of market operation.\nThe NOW Wallet has both a desktop crypto wallet and mobile versions suited for iOS and Android, making it ideal for both businesses and users with on-the-go attitudes. In fact, the features borrowed from the parent exchange make NOW Wallet ideal for business needs thanks to its dedicated portfolio formation options that can be suited for both personal and enterprise application.\nMost importantly, NOW Wallet allows users to conduct operations right inside the application thanks to the built-in exchange service from ChangeNOW, which facilitates cryptocurrency purchases for fiat via a convenient on-ramp. This means that users no longer need to export their assets from the wallet to external trading venues and are thus freed from the burden of having to pay extra commissions.\nWith its round-the-clock support service that provides prompt troubleshooting, NOW Wallet is truly user-oriented, especially taking into consideration the fact that its internal crypto exchange rate is always in favor of the user. Weekly updates and a robust user interface that is both streamlined and easy to navigate give NOW Wallet a considerable edge in the UI and UX departments. NOW Wallet also supports over 500 cryptocurrencies and 70,000 trading pairs across more than 40 blockchain networks.\nSecurity\nWith security being in top focus on the part of users, NOW Wallet has the given aspect covered, in large part thanks to its legacy of the ChangeNow exchange, which has perfected its security measures. KYC and identity verification are not mandatory for accessing funds stored on NOW Wallet, but it does allow users to retain control of their private keys and includes the standard lineup of security features like 2-Factor Authentication. A recently included function is protection from dust attacks, since NOW Wallet hides spam transactions from the history feed and thus safeguards users from unnecessary information flows.\nSpecial Functions\nNOW Wallet comes equipped with a long list of special functions and features that place it rightfully at the top of the given lineup of candidates for the title of best crypto wallet:\nOn-ramps for cryptocurrency purchases using fiat;\nStaking options for BNB , NOW , TRX , ATOM , SOL , and XTZ ;\nOptions for storing, transferring and receiving NFTs ;\n0.1% cashback for operations carried out through the ChangeNOW Pro application;\nAvailability of WalletConnect with QR code inside the application for connection to Dapps on various networks, including Ethereum, BSC, AVAX, Polygon, Fantom, Optimism, and Algorand;\nMultiple wallets formation options for tailoring the wallet to personal or business use cases;\nCustom token addition options.\nPros\nMultifunctional;\nUser-friendly interface;\nFree to use;\nNon-custodial;\nHigh resilience to external influence;\nMobile and desktop options;\nIn-app cryptocurrency purchase and exchange options.\nCons\nNo support for Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets;\nRelatively new product.\nCoinbase is a popular name on the cryptocurrency market thanks to its established reputation as a reliable exchange. The Coinbase Wallet is the result of continued development of the platform, offering users a reliable non-custodial digital asset storage option. Coinbase Wallet is hosted solely on the mobile device of the user, bypassing the parent exchange’s servers, thus allowing the owner to retain complete control over their private keys.\nThe wallet supports thousands of different tokens from the Ethereum network and all other EVM-compatible networks, including Poylgon, Avalanche and C-Chain. Among the other assets presented on the list are stablecoins, such as USDT, USDC and DAI.\nSecurity\nCoinbase Wallet leverages Secure Enclave Technology for safekeeping users’ private keys on mobile devices.

Among its distinguishing features is its integration into Decentralized Finance platforms and support for NFTs with management options. Ledger allows users to take advantage of its desktop and mobile versions for a variety of operations, including staking, swaps, transfers, and purchases.\nSecurity\nAs one of the most prominent brands in the decentralized industry, Ledger needs no introduction in regards to security. All Ledger applications and wallets take advantage of Secure Element technology – a specialized security chip often found in passports and other high-priority cards. Use of the given technology adds a completely new level of security to all Ledger applications.\nSpecial Functions\nLedger is rich with special functions that have been added over the years of the product’s market presence, which include:\nIntegrated access to DeFi platforms;\nNFT management options;\nBluetooth connectivity;\nNative Ledger Live application used for crypto lending and staking alongside sales and purchase options;\nCryptocurrency price tracking;\nFiat on-ramp and crypto purchase for fiat options;\nStaking options for assets from the ETH , SOL , ATOM and DOT networks.\nPros\nUnprecedented security level;\nCrypto for fiat purchase options;\nHigh resilience to external factors.\nCons\nRestrictive price, compared to other wallets;\nHacked in July of 2020;\nHigh risk of counterfeit;\nNo direct operations can be conducted from the wallet.\nAnother popular name on the market that inspires confidence.

Trezor became the first hardware wallet ever to be fielded and has since evolved to Trezor One – a hugely popular option among cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Trezor made its reputation thanks to its impeccable security, ease of use, and relative affordability when compared to its competitors like Ledger.\nSecurity\nTrezor retains the user’s private keys on the device in offline mode at all times. In order to access the wallet, users need to enter a PIN code, with transaction confirmation made by means of pressing physical buttons on the device. The wallet can also be connected via hardwire to another device for streamlining use.\nSpecial Functions\nTrezor is a hardware wallet at heart that boasts a limited number of features, including:\nComprehensive step-by-step wallet setup support;\nSupport with purchase and exchange operations;\nDirect crypto purchase of crypto for fiat options;\nIntegrated trading venue.\nPros\nExtreme level of security;\nCrypto for fiat purchase options;\nCompatibility to leading exchanges.\nCons\nLack of support for the Solana, Tron, and Polkadot networks;\nAndroid mobile device support only;\nPaid;\nNo integrated options for the sale, purchase, transfer and exchange of digital assets, or connection to DeFi applications.\nBottom Line\nWhen answering the question why a crypto wallet is important, one must also ask whether the crypto wallet in question is safe. The best Dapps wallet options always come with top-notch security in mind and a host of additional features to make sure users are retained. Be it cashback or staking options, all non-custodial wallets on the list presented in the given material have something special to offer their users. But interface convenience and customer support aside, if any single wallet is to be considered in the spotlight, the title of best overall non-custodial crypto wallet would certainly go to NOW Wallet thanks to its versatility, functionality, and security.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The loan, which was fully funded in just 90 minutes, marks a major milestone for the Defi platform and underscores its growing popularity among users.\nWhat is a Parachain Crowdloan?\nA parachain crowdloan is a fundraising mechanism that allows a project to secure the necessary funding to build and operate a parachain on the Polkadot blockchain. Parachains are independent blockchains that are connected to the main Polkadot network, allowing them to share resources and security while maintaining their own unique features and functionality.\nTo secure a parachain crowdloan, a project must first submit a proposal to the Polkadot community, outlining its vision and goals for the parachain. If the proposal is approved, the project can then begin the process of raising the necessary funds through a crowdloan campaign.\nIn the case of Pendulum, the project was able to secure full funding for its parachain in just 90 minutes, setting a new record for the fastest parachain crowdloan on Polkadot.\nPendulum's Success Attributed to Strong Community Support\nPendulum's success in securing its parachain crowdloan can be attributed to its strong community support and the growing demand for Defi platforms. Pendulum has built a reputation for offering high-quality, innovative Defi solutions and has garnered a dedicated following among users.\nIn addition to its fast-growing user base, Pendulum has also received significant backing from prominent investors and industry leaders. This support, combined with the platform's strong reputation and user-friendly interface, likely contributed to the rapid funding of its parachain crowdloan.\nWhat's Next for Pendulum?\nWith its parachain crowdloan fully funded, Pendulum is now well-positioned to continue expanding and improving its Defi platform. The project plans to use the funds to develop new features and services, as well as to continue growing its user base.\nA technical integration with the Stellar Foundation could be arriving very soon. The two sides have been working together on the much-awaited Spacewalk bridge. The achievement would see the first ever technical branch between Polkadot and Stellar’s chains. Once the trust-minimized bridge is live, Pendulum will gain the ability to start interacting with an array of fiat stable tokens.\nPendulum's success in securing its parachain crowdloan is a testament to the growing demand for Defi solutions and the potential of the Polkadot blockchain. As the Defi space continues to evolve, Pendulum seems well-positioned to play a leading role in shaping the future of decentralized finance.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto.\nIn the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.\nYesterday, we spoke with investment firm Blofin on their perspective on the past, present, and future of crypto. Today, we continue the series with David Schwed, former Global Head of Digital Assets Technology at BNY Mellon, the world’s largest custodian and securities services provider, and current COO at Halborn.\nSchwed: “What changed was the reality that too good to be true yields are exactly that, too good to be true. The money needs to come from somewhere, and it turns out that it was coming from risk loans and other business practices that relied on the steady increase of the price of crypto (…).”\nThis major financial institution, along with some of the biggest banks in the U.S., Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, finally embraced cryptocurrencies in 2021 and 2022. Still, recent events in the industry might impact crypto and digital asset adoption for legacy financial institutions.\nSchwed: “I haven’t seen any slowdown from TradFi when it comes to entering/expanding into the crypto markets.”\nTraditional Finances (TradFi) and Crypto Finances, in their many forms (CeFi, DeFi, etc.), have been converging. Will the collapse of Three Arrows Capital (3AC) and FTX push these institutions away from crypto? What is the likeliest regulatory outlook for 2023? We asked this former BNY Mellon executive this and much more. This is what he told us:\nQ: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid?\nA: What changed was the reality that too good to be true yields are exactly that, too good to be true. The money needs to come from somewhere, and it turns out that it was coming from risk loans and other business practices that relied on the steady increase of the price of crypto. As the price fell and the loans were due, many faced liquidation of their collateral and margin calls. That being said, we are seeing adoption in many other areas besides finance. Many major retailers are also entering the ecosystem, such as Nike, Matterl, Samsung, and LVMH.\nQ: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision?\nA: The narrative today needs to be risk management and security. Had 3AC/Voyager/Celsius and others had more institutional risk management practices, their demise may have been avoided. The same thought goes into security. There is a fundamental difference between crypto native security vs what we see in more mature financial institutions. We need to improve both drastically in order to restore trust.\nQ: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right?\nA: The most significant moment was the FTX crash. The progression of SBF from the hero who will save us all to a criminal in a matter of weeks is evidence of the lack of transparency in the ecosystem. We will certainly feel the impact as we head into 2023 . I don’t believe we’ve seen the full impact as it relates to other organizations who have some exposure to FTX or are generally over-leveraged. I believe by the end of 2023 we will be back to where we were in the beginning of 2022 in part due to the institutional/enterprise markets. I’ve heard “Crypto is dead” many times throughout the years and they’ve been wrong every time. While the current situation is much different since the price decline is a result of many systemic failures, the same can be said for many crashes observed in TradFi Wall Street, the most similar being the 2008-2009 crisis and TradFi is still alive and kicking.\nQ: Traditional finances (Tradfi) and crypto are merging in many ways. Will the collapse of FTX affect this trend? And in this context, do you see regulations leaning toward adopting an approach that will halt the integration between legacy and crypto financial companies?\nA: While the collapse of FTX and the resulting collateral damage has shown to have negatively impacted the crypto market, I haven’t seen any slowdown from TradFi when it comes to entering/expanding into the crypto markets. In fact, many of the G-SIBs (Globally Systemically Important Banks) that I have spoken to have not changed or altered their roadmaps as it relates to crypto. I haven’t seen any indication of regulations halting the integrations between traditional and crypto. That being said, I believe we will see sweeping regulation in the crypto markets similar in size and scope of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,800 with sideways movement across the board.

The report highlights how trends have emerged in the demographic they sampled, reflecting a shift in preferences among U.S. crypto users.\nThe report, titled \"The Dynamics and Demographics of U.S. Household Crypto-Asset Use\" was co-authored by the company's President, Chris Wheat, and George Eckerd, the firm's Financial Markets Research Lead. According to the authors, their methodology went through \"de-identified data covering a sample of nearly 5 million active checking account customers, over 600 thousand of which have conducted transfers to crypto accounts.\"\nThe research details how most crypto users based or registered from the U.S. increasingly made first-time transactions during the height of crypto-asset price surges. The report also points to how crypto usage is skewed towards \"men, Asian individuals, and younger individuals with higher incomes.\"\nThe report also found that holdings for each wallet tend to be \"relatively small\" given how median flows are equal to less than a week's worth of earnings. However, this is counteracted by the results that show how roughly 15% of users have net transfers that are over the average monthly income per individual. This points to how cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular among U.S. households, but their use has been relatively small in comparison to other investing options such as stocks and bonds.\nDespite this relative lack of exposure, a small subset of crypto users may have financial risk if the crypto market declines further. About 15 percent of crypto users have transferred over one month's worth of take-home pay into crypto accounts, making them more vulnerable to future price drops, compared than non-crypto investors; this percentage increases as the price of cryptocurrencies drops.\nThe trend also points to how most of these holders transferred crypto when prices \"were significantly higher than recent levels\" while the lower-income bracket of the demographic often made purchases at higher levels, compared to holders who had access to more income.\nWhen the price of a security rises quickly, households typically react by transferring money into that asset. The researchers from JPMorganChase thus concluded that this implies that the \"timing\" of these transfers is characteristic of \"herd behavior\". To add, the researchers note that American households tended to make large investments in cryptocurrencies during the period when their value was rising sharply.\nUsing data on the time of transfers to cryptocurrency accounts as a proxy for investment price, JPMorgan Chase's research found that households with lower incomes tended to purchase cryptoassets at substantially higher prices than other groups. According to the financial firm, this would also mean that at the rates that cryptocurrencies were trading at in late-2022, the majority of U.S. households would have been losing money overall if they had owned any cryptocurrency for more than a few months.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The company’s founders in the past served as senior executives at Morgan Stanley but left the traditional banking system seeking to spread universal financial access globally.\nPhemex doesn’t offer much more than our number ten pick but does have more prominence in the trading community. Phemex also has a launchpad, spot trading, and of course, derivatives contracts. Derivatives include copy trading and perpetual swaps with up to 100x leverage.\n#8) MEXC Global\nAnother platform launched in 2018, MEXC Global, boasts of its “mega transaction matching technology,” capable of 1.4 million transactions per second. In 2021, it was awarded the Best Crypto Exchange Asia by Crypto Expo Dubai.\nMEXC Global lets users buy crypto with a debit or credit card and trade spot crypto and leveraged EFTs, in addition to a wide range of futures with up to 200x leverage, settled in stablecoins or top crypto assets. MEXC also has a futures leaderboard and copy trading.\n#7) ByBit\nWhile Phemex was on its third anniversary, ByBit is now celebrating its fourth year in operation. It has since grown to include a Web3 wallet, high LTV crypto loans, a varied earn program with liquidity mining, crypto savings accounts, and a launchpool for staking new tokens. There’s also a launchpad, much like others on the list.\nWe will start to see a trend among some of the platforms listed. For example, top platforms will each offer the ability to buy crypto. ByBit is known best for its derivatives, with copy trading, options, and perpetual swaps with up to 100x leverage.\n#6) Deribit\nAlthough other platforms on the list are much more significant in terms of market share in futures and perpetual swaps, Deribit is the leader in cryptocurrency options. For many, options are the derivative contract of choice, while others prefer futures and perpetual swaps. Deribit offers BTC, ETH, and SOL options.\nBecause Deribit has the highest open interest out of all options platforms, it utilizes its unique market data through its insights blog, which traders can use to predict cryptocurrency market volatility or possible price movements. For example, when puts are at a record high, higher prices are possible if a contrarian move unfolds.\n#5) OKX\nOKX recently saw a rebrand that removed the “E” from its name to diminish the influence of the word exchange on its products and services lineup. OKX seeks to be viewed as a decentralized platform at the center of Web3. The platform offers solutions for developers, and a set of official decentralized applications users can take advantage of.\nOKX has it all in terms of derivatives, with futures, options, perpetual swaps, and margin trading at up to 125x leverage. There are also trading bots, a learn program, crypto loans, and a jumpstart program offering access to new projects from around the world.\n#4) Huobi Global\nHuobi Global is one of the longest-running platforms on the list, with a shocking zero security incidents in the past nine years of operation – a true testament to the platform’s top-tier security and risk management protocols. It commands a massive amount of crypto derivatives trading volume but has lost market share in recent years.\nHuobi’s longevity has given it time to develop a wide range of products and services, which include crypto loans, passive income, spot trading, and trading bots. In terms of derivatives, there’s once again a lot to offer, with futures, copy trading, and both American and European-style options to choose from. Supported leverage reaches 100x at maximum.\n#3) KuCoin\nKuCoin does everything it can to compete with Binance, complete with biting its logo and feature set. Others have also sought to go toe-to-toe with Binance regarding products and services, but the carbon copy is less blatant elsewhere. But being on par with Binance isn’t necessarily a bad thing – and market leaders are often copied.\nWhat KuCoin does offer is reliable and proven, with the ability to buy crypto, earn interest on crypto, trade spot, and access a web3 wallet. It also includes an NFT platform. Leveraged tokens are offered in addition to crypto futures at up to 100x leverage.\n#2) Binance\nYou might be surprised to find that Binance is no longer the number one cryptocurrency derivative platform in the market. The ongoing drama and close distance to the FTX fallout have tarnished the cryptocurrency platform’s reputation and made it a target of the US SEC and Department of Justice. World-renowned financial analysts call the platform and its CEO a “ticking time bomb.”\nThere has recently been a mass exodus of withdrawals of BTC – the largest ever recorded – due to fear over Binance potentially having similar issues as FTX. Fears include the BNB token being worthless in the event of a collapse, much like what occurred with the FTT token. Others believe Binance is too big to fail.\nBinance still dominates the cryptocurrency market in terms of overall trading volume, making it a mandatory inclusion in this list. It also has one of the most extensive ranges of products and services, including an NFT marketplace, an earn program, loans, a Binance card, spot trading, and derivatives. Futures, options, and leveraged tokens all max out at 125x leverage.\n#1) PrimeXBT\nPrimeXBT has become the quintessential platform in the cryptocurrency market because it is the only one on the list to provide access to traditional asset classes like stock indices, commodities, metals, and forex currencies, in addition to a wide variety of popular cryptocurrencies. Using BTC, ETH, USDT, or USDC as collateral, traders can open long and short positions on more than 100 different trading instruments simultaneously.\nCryptocurrencies are becoming an increasingly important asset class, highly sensitive to macro factors such as recessions, inflation, pandemics, and interest rates. This makes the inclusion of assets like gold, the S&P 500, oil, and others more important to consider when trading crypto. With PrimeXBT, you don’t need to sell your crypto and can instead use it to margin trade with up to 200x leverage on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top cryptocurrencies. Leverage on traditional assets runs even higher, up to 500x.\nPrimeXBT was also a pioneer in copy trading, making its Covesting service among the most battle-tested, with the largest communities of top traders from around the globe. As of the time of this writing, the leaderboards have traders in the top five ranging from 1,000 to 4,000% ROI. Followers can, with a click, start automatically copying the trades of highly successful traders with proven performance metrics.\nOther bells and whistles include an award-winning crypto trading app for Android and iOS, the PrimeXBT Trading Academy educational website, PrimeXBT Contests, interest-bearing yield accounts, the best referral program in finance, and much more. What really put the platform over the edge was the recent award from Crypto Expo Dubai for the Most Trusted Crypto-Asset Trading Platform. Trust in 2023 will be more critical than ever before, giving the platform an advantage with the broader crypto community.\nConclusion\nWhile you can’t go wrong with any of the platforms on this list, PrimeXBT was picked as number one for a reason. For serious profits in 2023, the best crypto derivatives platform is PrimeXBT.\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The culprit of these phenomena is the BONE tokenomics, where only 70% of the total supply of 230 million BONEs is in circulation.\nBONE currently has a market capitalization of $131.5 million, and the number of its holders, including Ethereum whales, is 64,166 addresses.

Sullivan & Cromwell indicated that it had drawn only a little more than $3 million of that, and that was for services rendered in the days leading up to the rushed bankruptcy filing according to reports by Bloomberg Law.\nSullivan & Cromwell is a firm headquartered in New York City that received this retainer from West Realm Shires Service Inc. on behalf of FTX for legal services the firm required.\nAvailable information indicated that FTX paid at least $15.5 million to avail and retain the firm’s services. The court filing further revealed that the law firm currently holds $9 million of the retainer.\nDevelopments in the FTX Case\nFTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 11 the same day that its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned. Following the shutdown of the exchange, FTX investors lost access to the funds they stored on the exchange. Most recently, the judge overseeing the SBF-FTX case, District Judge Ronnie Abrams recused herself from the case after she revealed that a law firm employing her husband as a partner had previously advised FTX in 2021. Abrams further explained that the reason for her recusal was informed by the fact that the law firm represented parties that may be adverse to FTX and its former CEO, SBF, in other legal proceedings.\nSBF was also released on a $250 million bail bond secured by his parents who offered up their home in Palo Alto, California as collateral. The conditions of SBF’s bail also include a written promise that he appears for future court appearances and he does not engage in any illegal activities. SBF also had to hand over his passport, must wear an ankle monitor, and be confined to his parent’s home in Palo Alto.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Delphi Digital highlights an important problem that Ether has with decentralization.\nUsually, the composition of holders is the go-to metric for determining a network's decentralization and health. However, in the case of Ethereum, staking is just as important as the distribution of funds. According to Delphi, only four entities manage almost all of the network's staking, and the biggest of them have some systematic issues with decentralization.\nLido Finance remains the biggest staker on the network, but its underlying system of redistributing stETH tokens has some critical flaws. After delegating \"real\" coins to Lido, investors receive liquid stETH tokens that they can trade while having Ethereum in locked contracts. However, there is a problem.\nIf you are an investor willing to withdraw your Ethereum from Lido's contracts, you simply will not be able to do so as no ETH has been unlocked from contracts, which raises a lot of concerns among investors.\nThe other stakers on the network are centralized cryptocurrency exchanges that either use the funds of investors who willingly delegate their assets for staking or use their funds in order to redistribute and diversify their holdings.\nAdditionally, Ethereum has been going through a tough year with the number of OFAC-compliant blocks reaching new highs, making the network more centralized. However, with the incentives that Ethereum developers and MEV relays have implemented, the network should become less regulated as time goes by."}, {"date": "2022-12-25 10:20:00", "entity": ["xrp", "xrp", "xrp", "coin", "xrp", "xrp", "xrp"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "Despite moving in local uptrend, XRP is not close to recovery, especially in long-term perspective\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

With only a few million of Shiba Inu burned, the token's placement on the market will not change, even during better market conditions.\nBy taking a quick look at the current state of Shiba Inu on the market, it becomes obvious that the token is greatly oversold and could rally upward with the help of any kind of inflow.

We will talk with multiple guests to understand this year’s highs and lows for crypto.\nIn the spirit of Charles Dicken’s classic, “A Christmas Carol,” we’ll look into crypto from different angles, look at its possible trajectory for 2023 and find common ground amongst these different views of an industry that might support the future of finances.\nWe kicked us this special with an institutional guest, asset management firm Blofin. In early December, they wrote an essay called “Catastrophe, Survival, and Evolution: Writing After November’s Crypto Markets” which inspired this series.\nBlofin: “One of the apparent signals is that in December 2022, monthly crypto spot volumes have returned to 2020 levels.”\nIn their essay, the firm argues that the crypto industry has been heavily impacted by the collapse of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, FTX, Terra (LUNA), and others. These events forced crypto investors into inactivity as their confidence in the sector shattered.\nBlofin: “There is no doubt that crypto is the future direction of finance. Still, a series of previous events have shown that if investors’ money cannot be protected, they will eventually give up the crypto market (…).”\nBut there is light at the end of the tunnel for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; albeit a long recovery is ahead, the nascent asset class will emerge from its ashes. For Blofin, the crypto industry is on the brink of a critical evolution. Once completed, the sector will rise again on the back of new institutional support. This is what they told us:\nQ: What’s the most significant difference for the crypto market today compared to Christmas 2021? Beyond the price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others, what changed from that moment of euphoria to today’s perpetual fear? Has there been a decline in adoption and liquidity? Are fundamentals still valid?\nA: The most significant difference comes from two aspects: liquidity and investor confidence. In 2021, the liquidity of the crypto market is still sufficient, and the impact of the liquidity contraction in the risk asset market has not yet fully manifested. In 2022, with the Fed’s (U.S. Federal Reserve) continuous interest rate hikes, Luna’s collapse, 3AC Capital’s (Three Arrow Capital) bankruptcy, and chapter 11 of the FTX exchange, the liquidity of the crypto market is basically squeezed dry. One of the apparent signals is that in December 2022, monthly crypto spot volumes have returned to 2020 levels.\nIn addition, the blow to investor confidence from a series of events in 2022 will be huge. At Christmas 2021, institutions and retail investors feel they have a lot to do in the crypto market. At the end of 2022, even professional investment institutions have lost so much due to the collapse of exchanges. As a result, they no longer trust the crypto industry; they feel that there are Ponzi schemes and scammers everywhere. In the end, institutions choose to withdraw funds, followed by retail investors.\nHowever, the number of investors in the crypto asset market is still high. Many people are just not active in a bear market, but that doesn’t mean they have left the crypto market. They are watching and waiting for the best time to buy the dip. Non-Zero on-chain addresses are still increasing steadily, and the hash rate of miners has not been significantly affected by the bear market in 2022.\nThe influence of fundamentals is still valid for the crypto market, but it is mainly concentrated on the macro perspective. During the bear market period, liquidity is concentrated in BTC and ETH, and it is difficult for altcoins to obtain more liquidity. Therefore, macro factors such as interest rate hikes and strong USD significantly impact BTC and ETH. At the same time, because of the bad liquidity status, improvements in the fundamentals of altcoins and project tokens are difficult to bring about sustained performance improvements.\nQ: What are the dominant narratives driving this change in market conditions? And what should be the narrative today? What are most people overlooking? We saw a major crypto exchange blowing up, a hedge fund thought to be untouchable, and an ecosystem that promised a financial utopia. Is Crypto still the future of finance, or should the community pursue a new vision?\nA: In our opinion, the changes in the market in 2022 depend on the position of the crypto market in the risk asset system. There is no doubt that crypto assets are at the tail end of the risk asset market due to the high volatility levels of the crypto market and the “Wild West” era it is in. Therefore, once there is any trouble, it is easier for investors to choose to sell and form a run, causing a more significant crisis.\nThe crypto market in 2022 is somewhat like the Nasdaq in the late 1990s. Adventurers and warriors gained a lot of wealth before 2000 and in 2021, which stimulated more people to come and take risks. Most people ignore the risks and end up with nothing.\nTherefore, compliance and security should be an integral part of the future narrative of the crypto market. There is no doubt that crypto is the future direction of finance (faster speed, more programmatic, more global, more reasonable credit system, and more substantial innovation potential). Still, a series of previous events have shown that if investors’ money cannot be protected, they will eventually give up the crypto market and will not continue to pay for the potential of the market and new technologies, even if these technologies have potential and attractiveness.\nQ: If you must choose one, what do you think was a significant moment for crypto in 2022? And will the industry feel its consequences across 2023? Where do you see the industry next Christmas? Will it survive this winter? Mainstream is once again declaring the death of the industry. Will they finally get it right?\nA: The collapse of FTX is the culmination of the 2022 bear market in the crypto market. The incident interrupted the slow recovery process of the crypto market and aroused widespread concern from regulators in major markets such as the US and the EU. In addition, many institutions have closed down due to the collapse of FTX or encountered operational difficulties and urgently need rescue.\nIt can be expected that in 2023, the aftermath of the FTX incident may eventually cause some institutions to go bankrupt, and more regulatory policies will also be introduced. In addition, from a macro perspective, due to the continuation of high interest rates, it is difficult for the crypto market to usher in new liquidity, and it will take longer to recover.\nHowever, in the above questions, we have mentioned some characteristics of the crypto market that are difficult to be replaced by traditional markets (faster speed, more programmatic, more global, more decentralized, more reasonable credit system, and more substantial innovation potential). Therefore, as long as investors have trading needs, the crypto industry will continue to exist, but it will become more compliant and secure.\nQ: To summarize for our readers, what sectors have been the most resilient in this crisis? Which ones are the most likely to recover in 2023? And how do you see the evolution of the nascent industry playing out?\nA: Considering the degree of acceptance, mainstream currencies such as BTC and ETH are still the most resilient sectors in the crypto market. Public chains and crypto infrastructure are also one of the most resilient sectors in the crypto market in the future, for all applications in the crypto market need their support.\nIn addition, the exchange sector is also quite resilient, for as the market stabilizes and gradually recovers, the trading needs of investors still exist and will start to grow again. Looking back at the history of the crypto market, many exchanges will go bankrupt in each bear period, but new exchanges will emerge in the bear market and shine in a new round of bull.\nHowever, it is difficult to determine who will be the first to recover in 2023. Since there is still a long time before the liquidity faucet reopens, the current liquidity shortage situation is still difficult to improve. The crypto market will likely continue to consolidate at a low level for a long time.\nThe crypto market is now at the end of the “Wild West”. As the crypto market continues to develop and mature, after the events of 2022, lawmakers will gradually have examples to help, and the regulatory and compliance framework will also take shape. The above may limit the crypto market’s development in some directions, but it is also good for the long-term growth of the crypto market. Under the compliance framework, more funds from traditional markets and other sources can enter the crypto market, and the builders of the crypto market will have more opportunities to obtain investment.\nAs of this writing, Bitcoin trades at $16,800 with sideways movement across the board.

The value of one DOGE is 8.8% lower than it was this time last week and it currently trades for $0.077119.\nDogecoin’s popularity waned this week when the cryptocurrency’s number one fan, Twitter/Tesla CEO Elon Musk, tweeted a poll asking whether he should step down from Twitter. The majority of respondents, some 10 million people, voted “Yes.” Much yikes, very ouch.\nDouble-digit percentage losses were felt by holders of Solana (SOL), which crashed 15% to $11.86. Cardano (ADA) dropped 13% to $0.259728, Polkadot (DOT) sank 14% to $4.47, Avalanche (AVAX) fell 10% to $11.78, and Quant (QNT) dropped 12% to $105.\nEthereum Classic (ETC), Uniswap (UNI), Litecoin (LITE) and Polygon (MATIC) all posted similar losses of around 9%.\nFinally, there were whispers in Washington this week that the FTX debacle could spell the end of centralized crypto exchanges.\nThe SEC has escalated its assault on the crypto industry via the investigation. The agency is targeting FTX bigwigs for securities fraud by labeling the exchange’s native token FTT as a security. It’s a subtle semantic shift, implying the SEC now views the token as a security in itself regardless of how it was marketed to consumers.\nWith another year about to close, it’s worth zooming out and considering where 2022 fits into the crypto narrative. It was another rollercoaster year, but unlike the heady peaks of 2021, this was most certainly a painful trough for everyone in the industry in some way or another.\nBitcoin more than halved over the course of the year (though there's still a week left for a miracle to happen) while Ethereum depreciated by a factor of three.

The contagion from both events spread far across the industry, bankrupting many firms and providing us with case studies in what not to do.\nInterestingly, Bitcoin’s popularity among retail investors—regular Joes as opposed to institutional investors, like Tesla and MicroStrategy—exponentially grew over the course of the year. In 2020, just 12% of the total supply was in the people’s hands, but by now, that figure has blown up to a little over 17%, an all-time high proportion."}, {"date": "2022-12-24 17:00:00", "entity": ["cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "hideaways", "hideaways", "hideaways", "cardano", "hideaways", "terra luna", "ftx", "hideaways", "ada", "cardano hideaways", "cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "hideaways", "cardano", "telegram"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral"], "content": "Cardano (ADA) may be the most underwhelming performer among all crypto majors this year.

Two major collapses—that of Terra and FTX—had a significant impact on the price action of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap and sent shockwaves across the industry.\nWhile some major figures made decisions or statements that put them on the naughty list, others remained focused on their respective missions and continued to bring hope to the industry. Crypto Santa is pleased with these leaders. (Click here for this year's Naughty List.)\nAD\nAD\nVitalik Buterin\nAs a cofounder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin has played an essential role in the development of the blockchain. Ethereum’s move from the energy-intensive proof-of-work blockchain to proof-of-stake had been anticipated for years, and many wondered if it would work at all. But Buterin and the Ethereum development team had a successful Merge at the beginning of September.\nDespite all the bear market chaos, Buterin has continued to be a sound voice of reason in the crypto industry. When FTX collapsed, Buterin critiqued those who wished to discard every value Sam Bankman-Fried stood for (Bankman-Fried was known for living below his means and being vegan, among other things). While he acknowledged Bankman-Fried’s manipulation of the concept of “effective altruism,” Buterin urged Crypto Twitter to remain level-headed and not throw the baby out with the bathwater.\nButerin also criticized traders speculating on governance tokens, arguing that manipulating governance token price and ownership was “pathological” and goes against the ethos of such tokens. And Buterin’s not afraid to critique Bitcoiners, either—he pointed out that many have ignored El Salvador’s undemocratic government because they were blinded by the promise of Bitcoin mass adoption.\nJack Dorsey\nTwitter founder and longtime Bitcoiner Jack Dorsey has largely remained out of the spotlight this year—but he’s continued to advocate for decentralized social media and personal privacy. As the CEO of Block, Dorsey revealed plans for a tongue-in-cheek “Web5” this year, which aims to offer self-custodied data and take an entirely different approach to the worldwide web. Dorsey remains a Web3 critic, but his consistent stance seems to come from a place of genuine concern for the future of technology.\nEdward Snowden\nWhile Edward Snowden may be a controversial figure, he has continued to advocate for individual privacy rights. This year, it came to light that Snowden was involved with the creation of the privacy-focused cryptocurrency ZCash.\nIn an interview with Decrypt, Snowden also took a strong stance against the U.S. sanctions placed against Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash, calling the move “profoundly authoritarian.” He also raised concerns about the amount of user identity data exchanges like Coinbase require in order to use their services, and has remained a vocal proponent of cryptocurrency when used to promote user privacy and freedom of exchange.\nWylie Aronow and Greg Solano\nWylie Aronow and Greg Solano, two of the four founders of the Bored Ape Yacht Club and Yuga Labs, have had quite a year. NFT sales for their upcoming metaverse game Otherside saw a shocking $561 million within 24 hours, bringing the Ethereum network to a crawl. Just two months later, they allowed select users to explore an early version of their game as a “first trip.” They held a successful, star-studded “Apefest” concert event for Ape NFT holders and launched a DAO and an altcoin called “Apecoin” for their community. Aronow and Solano also began donating CryptoPunks NFTs to art museums in an effort to teach audiences about Web3 and solidify the NFTs’ status as digital fine art.\nAronow and Solano have kept working on their vision despite a barrage of half-baked Nazi conspiracy theories and an SEC investigation this year. Regardless of what you think about these two cofounders, they’ve undoubtedly held fast to their community and are working at a breakneck pace to make their dreams a reality.\nAD\nAD\nRyan Wyatt\nIn January, Ryan Wyatt left his role as YouTube’s Head of Gaming to become the CEO of Polygon Studios, a company focused on bringing Web3 projects to the Ethereum sidechain. In less than a year, Polygon has seen a huge uptick in mainstream adoption from brands like Starbucks, Reddit, and Instagram.\nWyatt has also remained charismatic and professional on social media, offering to help move projects off the Terra blockchain to Polygon when the Terra ecosystem collapsed in May this year. As we move into 2023, it’s likely Wyatt will remain a key player in the Web3 gaming space—and a voice of reason for those gamers still struggling to wrap their heads around NFTs.\nJustin Blau\nDJ and electronic music producer Justin “3LAU” Blau can now add CEO, cofounder, and entrepreneur to his list of titles. Since his music rights NFT marketplace Royal raised funding back in 2021, the Royal team has been busy dropping major releases from big-name artists and building out its NFT marketplace. In November, the anticipated marketplace went live despite the ongoing bear market—a move that shows Royal’s commitment to delivering on its vision for Web3 music.\nBlau has also become something of a key advocate for Web3, onboarding and inspiring musicians like his friends Steve Aoki and Dillon Francis. What’s next for Royal? In an interview, Blau told Decrypt that Royal’s likely to release a mobile app—and the startup will try its best to work around Apple’s controversial 30% in-app purchase fees to keep NFTs affordable for fans and profitable for artists.\nChangpeng “CZ” Zhao\nIn a rare feat, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao made both our “Naughty” and “Nice” lists this year, primarily because the executive hasn’t shied away from sharing his hot takes on Crypto Twitter.\nYou could see his \"recent revelations\" tweet that prompted the FTT selloff that brought down FTX as more damaging for the industry than helpful, but the other perspective on it is that he wisely called out FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried well before the FTX collapse (including saying on our gm podcast that SBF’s attempts to bail out troubled firms were deals he would not have made).\nCZ has also remained calm and collected throughout the bear market, repeatedly arguing that bear markets are “healthy” for crypto long-term and filter out bad actors from the industry. In CZ’s view, only the good will survive.\nBinance expanded into Europe this year, increasing crypto’s overall chances of mass adoption.

The approval is however subject to a set of criteria established by a new regulatory framework that was enacted into law by outgoing President Jair Bolsonaro.\nBrazil Signs Crypto Regulation into Law\nOn Thursday, the Brazilian president approved a crypto regulation bill that established a crime of fraud involving virtual assets that will come with a penalty of between four to six years in prison along with a fine. The bill further established a “virtual service provider” license, which will be required by digital asset firms, including exchanges and trading intermediaries. The bill does not allow Brazilians to use crypto such as Bitcoin as legal tender but does include various digital currencies under the definition of legal payment methods within the country.\nGuidelines for Investment Funds to Include Crypto\nInvestment funds will be allowed to hold crypto assets but will be subject to a set of criteria established by Bolsonaro’s newly enacted law. Per this new law, crypto assets may be included in a fund if they are traded entities authorized by the CVM, Brazil’s central bank, or by a local supervisor in the case of operations in another country. Under the criteria, supervisory bodies must be legally competent to supervise and inspect the operations carried out, including ensuring that anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines are implemented, and counter-financial terrorism guidelines are adhered to.\nAlthough there was a delay in approving the new regulatory framework, the CVM in October already published a guidance opinion for the market on the crypto sector. According to this guideline, even though crypto assets are not expressly included among securities, market agents must analyze the characteristics of each crypto asset, to determine whether it is a security.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

(Click here for this year's Nice List.)\nAD\nAD\nSam Bankman-Fried\nOnce a mainstream media darling, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried turned from hero to villain when FTX collapsed this year. FTX’s bankruptcy and the subsequent unraveling of SBF's “effective altruism” routine, allegations of fraud and misusing customer funds, secret political donations, and reports of a racy Bahamas “polycule” land SBF at the top of Decrypt’s naughty list. (As the biggest newsmaker of the year by far, he's also our Person of the Year.)\nJust months before FTX’s bankruptcy, SBF had positioned himself as a crypto savior of sorts, offering to bail out companies like Voyager Digital and BlockFi, which had become insolvent due to exposure to Do Kwon’s Terra—which itself collapsed in May.\nSBF had said he had billions to spare—but all that money quickly vanished when FTX experienced a bank run following revelations that its sister company, Alameda Research, was essentially broke. Alameda, as it turned out, mostly held illiquid tokens on its balance sheet, and much of that was in FTT—FTX’s own token.\nAs reports began to surface about SBF allegedly misusing customer funds and funneling assets through Alameda, SBF revealed that he was never the regulation-friendly corporate Democrat he had positioned himself to be. In reality, SBF made an equal amount of “dark” donations to the Republican party, and admitted to a Vox reporter that his interest in “effective altruism” was largely a sham.\nCaroline Ellison\nCaroline Ellison is the former CEO of Alameda Research, FTX’s sister company which has been accused of mishandling FTX customer funds to participate in high-risk leveraged trades in the billions of dollars. In addition to her high-risk trades, a Tumblr blog linked to Ellison also suggests an interest in Nazi-adjacent philosophies such as race science. The account also advocated for “imperial Chinese harem” polyamory and sported the username “Fake Charity Nerd Girl.”\nDo Kwon\nDo Kwon is the CEO of Terraform Labs and founder of the Terra blockchain and its failed algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD, or UST, which destabilized from its peg in May of this year, causing the prices of both UST and LUNA to crash. This was a major economic shock to the crypto industry, and third party exposure to Terraform Labs, UST, and LUNA created a ripple effect and sent BlockFi, Voyager Digital, Three Arrows Capital, and other firms into deep financial trouble.\nBut not only was Kwon the CEO behind the now-collapsed project and its associated tokens, but he was also well-known for his overconfident attitude on Crypto Twitter. He later said that he developed the persona for “entertainment value” and regretted “shitposting” so much on the social media platform.\nNow, Kwon is on Interpol’s Red Notice list, no longer allowed to have a South Korean passport, and is facing a $57 million class-action lawsuit in Singapore, among other concerns. His current location remains unknown, though he denies being “on the run” from authorities.\nAD\nAD\nElon Musk\nOh, Elon. The Tesla, SpaceX, and Boring Company CEO also became (reluctantly) the CEO of Twitter this year. After trying to back out from a $44 billion acquisition deal, Musk bought Twitter and immediately shook things up—dramatically.\nHe began firing the majority of Twitter’s workforce, put Twitter’s crypto products on hold, told employees to become “extremely hardcore” or leave, eliminated employee benefits, and started putting beds inside Twitter’s headquarters.\nWhile he’s yet to solve Twitter’s persistent bot problem, he did allow anyone to buy a blue checkmark for a few days—causing advertisers to pull out en masse and major confusion as seemingly “verified” users impersonated brands.\nAnd when it comes to crypto, Musk has paper hands. Tesla sold 75% of its Bitcoin in July this year because it said “Bitcoin impairment” affected the company’s overall profitability. Tesla dumped roughly $936 million of Bitcoin back onto the market despite Musk’s promise in 2021 that Tesla would not sell “any Bitcoin” that it owned.\nJesse Powell\nWhile Jesse Powell’s San Francisco-based crypto exchange Kraken remains afloat, Powell hasn’t exactly played the “nice guy” this year. He announced that he’s stepping back from his CEO role. And Kraken has faced multiple waves of staff layoffs despite the company asserting back in June that it was going to have a “global hiring push,” had not changed its “hiring plan” and would not layoff staff, instead claiming it still had “over 500 roles to fill” in 2022.\nPowell has also taken issue with anyone who wishes to discuss “pronouns,” called American women “brainwashed,” and previously said that the N-word, in his view, wasn’t a slur if used affectionately. Yikes.\nChangpeng “CZ” Zhao\nBinance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao makes our \"Naughty\" and our “Nice” list this year, largely for the same reason: the tweet that brought down FTX (whether CZ chooses to see it this way or not).\nSome quick background: As an early investor in FTX, Binance gained a large share of FTT tokens—5% of the entire supply—when FTX bought out Binance’s equity in the company last year.\nWhen it came out that most of the assets on Alameda’s balance sheet were FTT tokens, CZ tweeted that he planned to begin selling off Binance’s holdings of FTT, \"due to recent revelations that have came to light.\"\nThat tweet evidently inspired other FTT holders to follow suit, and the selloff collapsed the price of the token. This, in turn, led to a bank run on FTX, and the liquidity crunch then quickly forced the exchange to shut down and subsequently file for bankruptcy.\nAD\nAD\nZhao rejects the idea that his tweets may have led to or accelerated FTX’s bankruptcy, writing in December that “no healthy business can be destroyed by a tweet.” That may be true, but there’s no denying what CZ’s tweet did for market sentiment.\nAnd while there’s an argument to be made that helping to expose the FTX fraud for what it was is a net positive for crypto long-term (which is why CZ also makes the “Nice” list), FTX customers who still have funds trapped on the exchange probably wish things had worked out differently.\nAvraham Eisenberg, Mango Markets hacker\nWhat’s a crypto naughty list without hackers? In October, the Solana DeFi platform Mango Markets suffered a massive $100 million hack. Mango Markets said that the attack occurred through price manipulation of an oracle. The platform’s liquidity was drained, and it had to halt deposits. Thankfully, some of the funds were eventually recovered.\nAvraham Eisenberg later identified himself as a part of the team that hacked the protocol, behavior he said was legal. He later tried another exploit on the Aave protocol, but failed and lost millions.\nBNB bridge hacker\nBinance’s Smart Chain Bridge was hacked for a staggering $570 million in October. But Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that nearly 90% of the swiped tokens were successfully frozen on the blockchain, and the Binance Smart Chain was brought to a halt.\nShortly after, Binance burned roughly 2 billion BNB tokens in its 21st quarterly token burn, a move which helped make up for the losses incurred as a result of the hack.\nLazarus\nIt should go without saying that any group of North Korean crypto hackers easily qualify for Santa’s naughty list. Lazarus is a North Korea-backed hacker group that has attacked crypto firms in Japan and was blamed for the massive $622 million Ronin bridge hack earlier this year. It’s also been accused of being behind the $100 million Harmony Protocol hack.\nWhat’s their strategy? The group often uses phishing scams, posing as companies or other entities with links and attachments that contain malware. In fact, Lazarus was so destructive this year that the U.S. government said Lazarus’ repeated use of Tornado Cash was a main reason that the Treasury Department sanctioned the privacy mixing protocol this year.\n\"Monkey Drainer\"\nAll your Apes gone? It might have been the notorious “Monkey Drainer” hacker. The NFT “drainer” tool has netted thieves an estimated $4.3 million or more this year. While Monkey Drainer is likely one person—as blockchain examiner ZachXBT previously told Decrypt—its creator is also likely selling their malware drainer tool as a service to other aspiring attackers, with its creator taking a percentage of the ill-gotten gains.\nPixelmon founder “Syberer”\nWould you pay $8,000 for an ugly stock rendering of a pixelated creature? Neither would we. But back in February, the NFT market saw unprecedented speculation—and collections launched at sky-high prices left and right. The Pixelmon Ethereum NFTs were designed to be characters for an upcoming Pokemon-esque Web3 game. At a pricy 3 ETH mint ($8,100 at the time), expectations were high.\nAD\nAD\nWhen the NFT artwork was revealed, holders felt cheated by the low quality of the assets, and the collection became the laughing stock of Crypto Twitter for weeks.\nBut one particular Pixelmon—a green, Frankenstein-like creature—became an internet sensation precisely because he was so ugly. Crypto Twitter named him Kevin. Kevin’s shockingly ugly mug inspired NFT degens the world over to spawn derivative collections using his name and visage.\nPixelmon founder Syberer, also known as Syber, admitted the first round of NFT artwork—which garnered them $70 million—was a “horrible mistake.” The project took months to revamp the collection’s artwork and improve upon the original designs, which were partly derived from stock models. It also got a new CEO. Either way, Pixelmon’s hilariously painful $70 million debut definitely qualifies the NFT collection for this year’s naughty list."}, {"date": "2022-12-24 16:39:00", "entity": ["fide", "avalanche", "fide", "ava labs", "fide", "avalanche", "ava labs", "fide", "chess", "fide", "avalanche", "avalanche", "ava labs", "ava labs", "ava labs avalanche", "fide", "##ss fide", "avalanche", "avalanche", "fide", "fide _ chess", "fide", "world chess", "chess olymp", "fide", "avalanche", "ava labs", "fide"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Ava Labs, a Web3 organization overseeing the progress and promotion of the Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain, scores a long-term partnership with FIDE to introduce blockchain solutions to the world of competitive international chess.\nFIDE developing Web3 products on Avalanche: Check out major use cases\nAccording to an official statement by the Avalanche (AVAX) team, the blockchain was chosen by FIDE as a technical platform for its upcoming on-chain applications for chess players.

You’ll see a $4.75 million round for a thing called Earn Alliance. A $70 million raise for a thing called Ramp Network. A further $15 million for Roboto Games, $3.1 million for NFT game Burn Ghost, and a vertiginous $72 million for market maker Keyrock. There are even giddy plans for a $2 billion metaverse fund by Animoca Brands, while crypto derivatives exchange Matrixport, led by former Bitcoin mining kingpin Jihan Wu, is gunning for a $100 million raise—at a valuation of $1.5 billion.\nIt’s easy to understand why venture capital firms continue to take these risks. VCs are like sharks—they have to keep swimming by investing in crap (sorry, “decentralized technologies”) or they’ll die, even in a bear market. But why do they continue to put their riches into stuff that keeps failing?\nEverywhere you look, the industry appears to be in full tail-spin. Just last month, Multicoin Capital, Kyle Samani’s previously high-flying and exuberant firm, had its assets frozen due to exposure to FTX. Some of the biggest funders in the space, like Babel Finance, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX’s own venture arm, caused some of the biggest explosions. Star-studded companies like Blockstream, meanwhile, are writing their valuations down by orders of magnitude, and the $1.5 billion valuation sought by Matrixport looks positively modest compared to the $32 billion valuation once commanded by its now-deceased competitor.\nAll of this has caused an obvious chilling effect. Every VC firm and project I spoke to says they are being far more cautious than before with regard to investments. A Coinbase spokesperson noted carefully that funding has “tightened.”\nAnimoca Brands CEO Yat Siu, meanwhile, told me cryptically that “some deals may not make as much sense as they did a few months ago due to market circumstances or changes in valuations.”\nRamp Network business lead Paulina Joskow told me that she has heard of a number of projects failing to meet raising requirements, along with a number of deals falling through at the last minute. Many projects, she added, don’t look forward to anything bigger than a Series B before the VC taps shut off. Kevin de Patoul, the CEO of the market maker Keyrock, said he has noticed a fresh emphasis on “due diligence”—utterly unremarkable in most other industries, but something of a groundbreaking shift in crypto.\nAD\nAD\nBut eight-figure raises and sky-high valuations are still out there, much of it coming from the usual suspects. These are the well-capitalized firms that know when to cash out and how to manage risk. Their ranks include pedigreed industry participants like Ripple, Coinbase Ventures, Paradigm, Polychain Capital, Pantera, and the elephant in the room, Andreessen Horowitz. They are joined by firms from the Web3 sector, such as Animoca Brands, which is raising that optimistic $2 billion metaverse fund. (There are also a few obscure specialists like the VC firm “gumi Cryptos Capital,” Argonautic Ventures” and “Harrison Metal.”)\nPresumably the main way these companies stayed afloat was simply by not being exposed to FTX. Paradigm, which did invest in the exchange, managed to stay away from FTX’s FTT shitcoin. (Whether that was a result of virtuosic investment acumen or luck is up for debate.)\nBut experience counts, too. Animoca’s Siu told me his company learned a lot from enduring “the much colder and more forbidding environments” of the 2017-2019 bear market. Does that mean “crypto native” VCs stand a better chance than firms cultivated in the comparatively sane financial world? Don’t forget, after all, that FTX’s biggest funders weren’t Animoca or eGirl Capital, but legacy titans Tiger Global, Sequoia and Softbank. Were those non-crypto-native names too easily impressed by SBF’s song and dance?\nIt is also interesting to see where the post-bubble money is going without all that hype behind it. Many of the VC firms and portfolio projects I spoke with since the crash emphasized a conspicuous and renewed focus on “decentralized” investments.\nChris Perkins, of the VC firm Coinfund, said the multiple calamities of 2022 only confirmed his long-standing wariness of overly centralized crypto companies. He attributes his company’s continued survival to having avoided those projects.\n“As we started watching centralized entities fall apart, it—and I’m not saying we desired it—but it further fueled our thesis that we need to stay focused on decentralized technologies,” Perkins told me. Following the crash, he went so far as to actively prune his portfolio of a number of centralized investments. (Though he phrased that obliquely: “We took many thoughtful actions to mitigate counterparty risk.”)\nIt is true that a number of the projects getting funding are critical “infrastructure” projects. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin lending protocol Finterest raised $1.5 million, for instance, while Fleek, which hosts digital content in a decentralized way, raised $25 million. And there are a host of other decentralized projects that have raised money post-FTX crisis, though not all tame and uncontroversial: many indeed support infrastructure for things like high-stakes, decentralized derivatives trading.\nThe thinking is that decentralized tech is more transparent and less liable to the kind of financial chicanery that brought down FTX. (DeFi degens have shouted since the FTX collapse, “This is why you shouldn’t put your crypto on centralized exchanges!”) But wasn’t Terra, the algorithmic stablecoin that got buy-in from Coinbase and Galaxy, sort of decentralized? And isn’t even a polycule, technically, also kinda decentralized? Kinda?\nIt is important to remember that “decentralization” exists along a very long and convoluted spectrum—it is never absolute, and it never confers absolute trust. In some cases it just allows you to observe in real-time as the fraud takes place and “transparently” drains your life savings.\nSo it’s worth asking: Is the latest peer-to-peer Marxism token reaping VC money really “decentralized,” or do its three developers just run each new board proposal through a weird and experimental governance mechanism that’s only legal in Estonia? Note that almost all of the “decentralized” companies I reached out to had their own in-house PR. Would a mempool send out a canned PR quote?\nAD\nAD\nNeither is the purported shift to decentralization an overwhelming trend, and there are still signs of the old tendency toward crypto esoterica. A company called Dogami peddling adoptable dogs from outer space just raised $7 million, having apparently demonstrated a 200,000 strong user-base. and a blockchain game based on the popular 80s football manga series \"Captain Tsubasa\" has raised $15 million.\nThese projects are not obvious safe bets by any normal standard. They in fact sound very 2017 ICO era. But VCs still believe in crypto.\nIn an interview with reviled outlet The Block, Dogami’s founder stressed that VCs did a “lot” of due diligence before coughing up the cash.\nSiu of Animoca, which was involved in an earlier Dogami raise, told me that “no matter how kooky, esoteric and perhaps even whimsical” a project may be, “you need content in order to drive demand.” He added: “‘Build it and they will come’ is a difficult strategy when there is no demand. You need to have both so they can feed off each other.”\nOr maybe it’s that old-school, 2000s-era tech silliness that these particular projects embody, allowing them to keep their toes in the gaudy and more credibly profitable Web2 world. Burn Ghost, which raised $3.1 million and develops casual games featuring optional NFT prizes, has “a lot of flexibility on how and where we find our players, and is not solely dependent on crypto market conditions,” its founder and CEO, Steve Curran, told me.\nOf course, nobody is claiming companies like Burn Ghost and Finterest will be unicorns within the hour.

In the last 24 hours, it barely registered any price movement. It just depreciated by 0.8%. It was an indication of sideways trading for the altcoin.\nThe past week for LTC has been choppy owing to constant volatility amongst major market movers. Bitcoin has dropped in price over the last 48 hours, dragging most altcoins down with it. The technical outlook of the Litecoin price showed signs of struggle as the bears were still around.\nDemand for LTC slowed down, as did the accumulation. Buyers have continued to sell short as and when LTC lost its local support. From the technical outlook, the Litecoin price may present shorting opportunities for traders at some levels.\nFor the coin to move on the upside, demand has to return in the market. Bitcoin has to move back above the $17,000 price level for most altcoins to gain momentum. The market capitalization of Litecoin declined in the last 24 hours, reflecting bearish pressure in the market at press time.\nLitecoin Price Analysis: One-Day Chart\nLTC was exchanging hands at $65 at the time of writing. Even though the coin is consolidating at the moment, it can lose its local support. The immediate resistance for the coin stood at $68, and clearing that level will take the coin to $73.\nOn the flip side, the inability to remain over $64 will bring the coin to $63 and then to $61. When the coin falls to $63 and then to $61, this would be a shorting opportunity for sellers as the coin will start correcting after that.\nThe amount of Litecoin traded in the last session was in red, which indicated bearishness and more selling in the market.\nTechnical Analysis\nThe buyers were in control of the price of the asset for most of December. With increased market price volatility and Litecoin price consolidation, there was increased liquidation, causing buying strength to decline.\nThe Relative Strength Index was near the 30-mark, which was a sign of overselling.

Those who leave their savings in bank accounts are losing their purchasing power at an ever-increasing rate. Depending on which country you live in, you can be losing from 7% to 70%+ a year through inflation, and these are just the government-manipulated figures.\nAlong came cryptocurrencies, and the innovations that came with them, such as decentralised finance, NFTs, smart contracts etc., and these have disrupted the world of finance in a big way.\nHowever, with all such incredibly disruptive innovations, there have been many ups and downs, just as there were back in the dotcom revolution. Many hacks have taken place and many investors have lost funds in a pretty much unregulated sector.\nBe this as it may, plenty of the smartest minds are concentrated in the cryptocurrency space and many more are on the way - regulation permitting.\nStandard.io is a leading project in the DeFi space\nOne of the smartest projects in the DeFi space right now is Standard.io, a lending platform that enables users to lock up traditional, as well as crypto assets such as BTC and ETH, which can then generate fiat-pegged stablecoins.\nUsers lock up these assets in smart vaults, and then they can use the assets as collateral to mint sEURO, a euro-pegged stablecoin. Many other fiat-pegged stablecoins will be introduced in time.\nWhen a user locks up an asset into their smart vault, that user is the only individual that has the keys to open it. No financial entity, government or any other third party is involved. The user then has a call on up to 85% of the value of the collateral in the smart vault in the form of a stablecoin pegged to fiat currency.\nEven a traditional asset such as gold (and eventually silver) can be locked up in a smart vault. Such a thing has never been known in the financial world as gold has generally preserved your wealth but has never earned yield.\nUsers retain control of their assets and can access liquidity\nThe system Standard.io has developed offers a host of advantages to prospective users. One such advantage is the avoidance of taxable events. By depositing assets and receiving minted sEUROs there is no sale that takes place. Another advantage is to put minted sEUROs into liquidity pools and earn the fees that arise from this.\nHowever, probably one of the biggest advantages is the ability to safely keep one's assets and to unlock the liquidity therein. In essence, a user is borrowing from themselves when they take liquidity out of their own assets. The money you needed for a house deposit, or that new car now becomes your money (at 0% interest) and as long as you pay it back, you get to keep your original assets as well.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The “exchange reserve” is an indicator that measures the total amount of Ethereum currently being stored in the wallets of all centralized exchanges.\nWhen the value of this metric goes up, it means holders are depositing their coins to exchanges right now. One of the main reasons investors use exchanges is for swapping their ETH to another crypto or for cashing out in fiat. Thus, the exchange reserve can act as the selling supply of the asset, and so any increases in it can have bearish effects on the price.\nOn the other hand, a decrease in the indicator’s value implies investors are transferring out their coins at the moment, which suggests the selling supply is going down. Prolonged exchange withdrawals can be a sign that holders are accumulating currently, meaning that they are bullish on the crypto.\nNow, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Ethereum exchange reserve over the last few years:\nLooks like the value of the metric has been going down in recent months | Source: CryptoQuant\nAs the above graph displays, the Ethereum exchange reserve already saw some decline during 2021, but the downtrend has been even sharper in 2022. The indicator used here is the “all exchanges” version, meaning that it covers data related to both spot and derivative exchanges.\nAn interesting trend to notice is that the decrease in the metric’s value has been especially rapid since the collapse of FTX. This is because a well-known exchange like FTX going down made investors more vary of centralized platforms than ever, leading to them withdrawing their cryptocurrencies in mass from exchanges so that they can hold onto them in personal wallets, the keys to which they own.\nIn total, the Ethereum exchange reserve has gone down by more than 30% over the course of 2022. “One of the best things in the year has been the possibility of having a deflationary ETH,” says the quant. “It seems that investors believe it too and have withdrawn large amounts of CEX with the most likely purpose of holding them for the long term.”\nETH Price\nAt the time of writing, Ethereum’s price floats around $1,200, up 1% in the last week.\nETH has been moving sideways in the last few days | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from DrawKit Illustrations on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-24 11:05:00", "entity": ["shibburn", "whalestats", "whalestat", "shiba", "inu meme coin", "ethereum whales", "meme coins", "shib", "shib", "shiba", "shibburn tracker", "eth", "dai", "link", "##ereum aweth", "chain", "chainlink"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Shiba Inu community has again succeeded in pushing the burn rate up significantly as it burned a large amount of meme coins\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

All eyes have been on social when it comes to crypto news and discourse. Announcements are often made through social outlets like Twitter, community building for projects – whether DeFi, or NFTs, or anywhere in between – often occurs on social channels like Discord or Telegram, and other platforms are often utilized by crypto protocols and projects to communicate with the public, now more than ever.\nWith social media in the spotlight, the door is potentially ajar for a new player to enter the space; indeed, no single social platform has really made a splash in recent years with the lone exception of TikTok. Many have tried, few have found success. The latest to enter the arena have been decentralized social media protocols.\nCurrent Climate: Pulse Check\nThe social media conversation really has to start with Twitter: it’s become a cultural hub for crypto, a source for often first-moving news, and a centerpiece for some of the biggest names in the space to sound off around current events. The ever-so-infamous Sam Bankman-Fried and Binance CEO Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao have gotten into spicy back and forth dialogue on the platform; it’s easy to say that Twitter is the defacto hub for widespread crypto communities.\nHowever, Twitter has seen recent discourse and mixed reviews under the short duration of Elon Musk’s oversight thus far, and the implications surrounding Twitter are vast and far-reaching. Yes, even the impacts on Dogecoin are up for debate. Beyond Twitter, there has been mixed opinions when it comes to the degree that social media is a ‘public square,’ battling against the ideals expected from public – or in this case even privately-owned – platforms.\nIn past days, we’ve seen Facebook dabble – with limited success – in exploratory blockchain-related projects, and Reddit as another often-cited social media platform that has integrated crypto roots. Reddit has onboarded Polygon for whitelabeled NFT avatars, and has historically utilized Ethereum for channel reward points in the r/cryptocurrency sub-Reddit.\nMeanwhile, in the big picture, other legacy social platforms have generally been business as usual – and there has been no major movement for social companies in the blockchain space in the aftermath of FTX. What has entered the mix increasingly, however, is decentralized social media protocols. Is the ‘tokenize everything’ post-era… decentralize everything?\nEthereum (ETH) powers longtime blockchain social media network, Minds. | Source: ETH-USD on TradingView.com\nDecentralized Players Enter The Mix\nDiscourse surrounding the current social media landscape has opened the door for a number of ‘decentralized social media platforms’ to enter the mix. That includes the likes of Mastodon and Console, among many others, who have carved out their role as early movers in what could be an attempt at a ‘new wave’ of social media.\nMastodon has largely emerged as one of the more frequently-named players, but reviews have generally been a mixed bag with complaints largely resting around the platform’s UI and UX. The decentralized aspect in this context is especially unique for Mastodon in that there is no blockchain involved, but rather a self-hosted network encompassed of independently-run nodes.\nIn blockchain-related entrants, Minds is a platform often-mentioned that was created several years ago. It has an ERC-20 reward token, and boasts 6M+ members, largely owning the title of most notable blockchain-built decentralized social media platform. However, it seems that it has been Mastodon that has taken the lion’s share of new audience members during Twitter’s bumpy ride lately, seeing nearly a 10X in users over the past 90 days.\nMeanwhile, new competitors don’t shy away from getting involved; the aforementioned Console is a newer decentralized social media channel created by co-founder and ex-CEO of Triller, David Leiberman, and Columbia Web3 professor Chris Castig. Console recently released a beta version of the platform, which is focused on a ‘group chat’ first approach, and is slated for a mobile app release in early 2023.\nWhen it comes to decentralized social at large, however, not everyone is enthusiastic about where things could be headed. In a Wired opinion piece from 2017, three MIT Media Lab members speculated that decentralization in social media would face immense headwinds and “never work.” The piece cited various reasonings, some more broad, such as high barriers to entry from network effects (a reasonable claim, though not one limited to blockchain-related social networks but rather just new social media platforms at large – and certainly not insurmountable), and some more precise (such as the difficulty of managing private keys, which is an area with major potential for growth in the space).\nThere’s no way around it, we’re still in the middle of an ever-circulating social experiment, as we learn what works and what doesn’t when it comes to all things social."}, {"date": "2022-12-24 02:41:56", "entity": ["district of new york", "bankman - abrams", "ftx", "bankman - fried", "bankman - fried", "ellison", "ftx", "ftx", "abrams", "davis polk & wardwell", "ftx", "abrams", "andre ftx", "abrams", "davis polk & wardwell", "ftx", "andres", "ftx", "ftx", "abrams", "inner city press", "stanford", "ftx", "alameda research", "sec", "sec"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The judge assigned to oversee the blockbuster criminal trial of Sam Bankman-Fried recused herself from the case late Friday, citing a potential conflict of interest stemming from the fact that her husband’s law firm previously advised FTX, Bankman-Fried’s now-defunct crypto exchange.\nFederal judge Ronnie Abrams of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York formally withdrew from adjudicating the case on Friday afternoon, just one day after Bankman-Fried was released from custody to stay with his parents in their Palo Alto home as he awaits trial on eight criminal charges including wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and violations of federal campaign finance laws.\nAD\nAD\nAbrams’ husband, Greg D.

A timeline has not yet been established as to when that selection will be made.\nJudges in such circumstances are typically randomly assigned to cases, and only excluded from consideration if there exists a potential conflict of interest.\nIt’s unclear why Abrams waited until now to recuse herself, given that her husband’s firm’s connection to FTX was likely not new information. Often, judges mulling whether to recuse themselves from cases discuss such matters with their district’s chief judge, an ethics committee, and research precedent before making a determination.\nIn court on Thursday, another judge, Gabriel Gorenstein, approved a deal for Bankman-Fried to be released from prison on a record-setting $250 million appearance bond. Bankman-Fried did not actually have to pay a dime to secure his release: that money is only owed to the court (by the fallen crypto mogul, his parents, and another yet-be-named signatory) if Bankman-Fried fails to show up for any future court date.\nIn the meantime, the once-billionaire, who spent less than a week in jail in The Bahamas after his arrest there last week before being extradited to the U.S. on Wednesday, has arrived home just in time for Christmas.

ETH’s price is presently resting just above $1,200, and while this would have served as a good bounce-off point for the digital asset, it shows no signs of doing so.\nEthereum Price Stuck At $1,200\nGiven the current market circumstances, Ethereum at $1,200 presents one of the best prices that the market will see for the digital asset before 2022 runs out. The momentum in the market was already on a decline but the 49% jump in Ethereum’s trading volume in the last day put a perhaps temporary stop to that decline. Short-term indicators pointing towards sell points to this being temporary.\nNow, for the lull in price, it can be explained by ETH’s price sitting so close to the 20-day moving average of $1,247. Since there isn’t much movement in the market, it makes sense that the digital asset would only try to maintain its price at just above $1,200 at this time.\nBitcoin’s tight correlation to the stock market has also impacted Ethereum. Although cryptocurrencies did not fall like the stock market following the release of the US GDP data on Thursday, it definitely hindered any growth from taking place in the market.\nETH price struggling at $1,200 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\nWhy Is ETH Struggling?\nEthereum has received some bad press over the last couple of days. One of the most prominent was when the Paxful peer-to-peer exchange announced that it was delisting Ethereum. CEO Ray Youssef presented the reason as “Integrity over revenue” as the exchange believes that the network was not decentralized.\nThis stoked fears that had previously subsided following the move to proof of stake. For many, this move made Ethereum much easier to control and Youssef said, “One day you will need permission to use it.”\nGiven this, the price of ETH has buckled under the pressure of the FUD it created.

We continue to holistically evaluate what other measures need to be taken to serve our community and comply with applicable law,\" an OpenSea spokesperson told Decrypt.\nU.S. sanctions against Cuba are implemented by various authorities and can take the form of executive orders, federal statutes, and other regulations. Being rather complicated, these sanctions target a range of activities, including economic activity, hence the reason OpenSea does not allow the use of its services from Cuba.\nAs initially reported by Associated Press, Cuban artists insist they’ve never been told explicitly why their accounts were taken down, with some theorizing that OpenSea could be doing it out of an overabundance of caution. Adding to the confusion is the fact that many of the artists are Cuban ex-pats, no longer living on the island. The founder of NFTcuba.ART, Gianni D’Alerta, currently lives in the U.S., while Gabriel Bianchini, co-host of a project that featured Cuban artists at OpenSea during National Hispanic Heritage Month, is Swiss-Italian and lives in Spain, according to Artnet News.\nNFTcuba.ART didn’t immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.\nWho else is on the sanctions list\nThis is not the first time NFTcuba.ART complained about the OpenSea ban.

Binance (Binance Smart Chain): $566 million\nHackers hit a blockchain associated with the world’s biggest crypto exchange on October 6, making away with $566 million in BNB.\nThe exploit targeted the cross-chain bridge BSC Token Hub. Hackers essentially conjured tokens out of nothing using artificial withdrawal proofs. No users of Binance or its blockchain lost funds in this attack, though.\nDespite the huge amount of tokens pinched, the criminals weren’t able to pocket them all—Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said they were able to prevent around 80% to 90% of the targeted funds from being taken by the hacker.\nThis is because BSC chain validators froze the network following the attack—but hackers did manage to move around $100 million in funds to other chains.\n2. Ronin: $552 million\nHackers hit Ronin, a sidechain for the popular NFT game Axie Infinity, in March, pinching an estimated $552 million in Ethereum and USDC. When the exploit was disclosed by Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis one week later, the value of the funds stolen had risen to $622 million.\nHow’d they do it? By using “hacked private keys” to forge transactions and claim the funds.\nAD\nAD\nThe funds were laundered quickly—as they typically are in hacks—with around $7 million in Ethereum sent to cryptocurrency mixing service Tornado Cash (now banned by U.S. government).\nThe U.S. Treasury later identified wallet addresses allegedly tied to North Korea’s Lazarus hacking group in the attack.\n3. FTX: $446 million\nIt’s been the biggest crypto event—and arguably the biggest news story—of 2022: super-popular digital asset exchange FTX spectacularly collapsed, losing billions of dollars worth of funds.\nIt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy November 12, but that wasn’t the end of its woes: the celebrity-endorsed exchange was then hit by a mystery attack.\nAs a precaution do not update or touch your FTX account for the time being until there is further clarity. pic.twitter.com/T4Ga9nSlHr — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) November 12, 2022\nSeveral wallets allegedly belonging to FTX were drained of around $446 million in tokens. The funds were then moved around to other exchanges and converted into different cryptocurrencies.\nAnd it still isn’t clear who stole the assets. At the collapsed exchange’s first court hearing, counsel to FTX’s new management James Bromley said that a “substantial amount” of the exchange's assets are missing or have been stolen.\n4. Wormhole: $326 million\nDecentralized finance protocols got hit hard this year. DeFi is the catch-all term for apps that automate things banks and brokerages do, and they are still new and experimental. This means security is an issue, particularly with bridges, which allow users to transfer funds between chains.\nIn February, the popular bridge Wormhole got hit with an exploit. Hackers targeted its leg on Solana (where users must first lock Ethereum into a smart contract to get an equivalent amount in Wrapped Ethereum, or WETH) to mint tokens. 120,000 in WETH tokens, to be exact. At the time, that was $326 million.\nAD\nAD\nWETH is token pegged to the price of Ethereum on a 1:1 basis, useful in the DeFi world for moving around funds quickly.\nJump Trading, Wormhole’s parent company and a major player in the Solana ecosystem, was able to step in and save the day by replacing what was stolen and getting the bridge up and running again.\n5. Nomad: $190 million\nAnother bridge got hit in August.

Speaking for the first time since the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX, Cunliffe indicated that the BoE might soon regulate the industry to protect investors from the dangers of crypto trading, as well as the wider financial system against potential fallout associated with cryptocurrencies. Cunliffe said that the BoE’s stance is that retail investors should be able to safely speculate on cryptocurrencies, as they do in traditional markets.\nCunliffe said:\nI think for the majority of people if they do want to be involved in speculation in [crypto] ... for consumer protection and market integrity, they should have a place to do that where they get the protection they would get in a similar activity in the UK.\nCrypto is Becoming Increasingly Integrated into Traditional Financial Systems\nThe deputy governor added that cryptocurrencies are becoming increasingly integrated into the traditional financial system and therefore should be regulated soon rather than later. He noted:\nI do not know how that would [have] developed, but we had banks and investment funds and others who wanted to invest in it.\nDuring his interview with Sky News, Cunliffe said the trading of crypto assets has not yet been sizeable enough to destabilise the financial system, “but it was starting to develop links.” On that note, and commenting on the BoE’s future plans to manage digital assets, Cunliffe added:\nI think we should think about regulation before it becomes integrated with the financial system and before we could have a potential systemic problem.\nUK’s Regulatory Efforts\nAccording to the reports by Sky News, in the UK, regulators have attempted to, and failed, “to impose their write on crypto exchanges domiciled offshore.” When the now Prime Minister Rishi Sunak was chancellor of the exchequer, the government made it clear that its goal was to make the UK a “global crypto asset hub” – something which naturally will depend largely on an effective regulatory framework.\nCunliffe, in his role as being responsible for financial stability, said that the BoE’s previous regulatory efforts were aimed at protecting individuals and maintaining financial stability – a common goal of central banks. He said:\nThere's a lot of activity that's developed over the last 10 years on the trading and sale of crypto assets, assets without any intrinsic value, so they're incredibly volatile. And all of that has grown up outside of regulation.\nIn an attempt to explain the absolute need for effective regulation, the deputy governor drew upon the collapse of FTX to highlight his point:\nWhat we saw in FTX… is a number of activities which in the regulated financial sector, would have had certain protections. We saw things like clients' money appears to have gone missing, conflicts of interest between different operations, transparency, audit and accounting. All of the perhaps boring things that happened in the normal financial sector, didn't really happen in that set of activities. And as a result, I think a lot of people have lost a lot of money.\nBoE is in the Process of Developing its Own Digital Coin\nCryptocurrencies aside, the BoE does see the value in blockchain technology. The Central Bank is currently consulting on plans to develop its own central bank digital coin, a digital version of its currency that would offer the same security as a pound coin, but with the added benefit of digital flexibility that could see it replace cash. Recognising the value of a digital currency, Sir Jon commented:\nPhysical cash will always be made available by the bank as long as people want it and many people depend on it. But it's not fully usable in the way we live now. So the question for the Bank of England is that as the way we as society changes, as we live our lives more digitally, should we continue to provide money to the public which is usable across a range of transactions?\nHe further said:\nThis would be a digital equivalent of the' I promise to pay the bearer' promise, which in the end underpins confidence in money in the UK. Whenever you want, you can turn that money you hold in the bank into basically Bank of England money backed by the state with that promise to pay the bearer.\nFinally, realising that physical cash is becoming less feasible and practical, Sir Jon said:\nWe want to ensure that as physical cash becomes less usable in many parts of the economy, perhaps we need to offer something digitally to provide that underpinning.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Momentum surged in the early months of the year before crashing down to earth alongside crypto prices, marking an end to much of the speculative frenzy.\nBut another year of NFT growth brought some fresh wrinkles to the space. We saw expanded use of NFT artwork to build brands and projects, for example, but also consolidation of IP made for a decentralized world and disputes over the nature of NFT creator royalties. Amid the turbulent market, there were bright spots and significant roadbumps alike.\nAD\nAD\nWe’ve covered the evolving NFT space all year long at Decrypt, but if you haven’t been following closely, here’s a recap of the stories that dominated the space in 2022.\nBud Light brings Nouns to Super Bowl\nBrands have flooded into the NFT space, but Bud Light’s play for the Super Bowl was truly unlike any other. Ethereum project Nouns—which is building open-source IP through a DAO community—granted the popular beer brand one of its high-value NFTs. And in return, Bud Light put the project’s boxy “Noun glasses” into its Super Bowl commercial.\nWith help from Vayner3, Gary Vaynerchuk’s Web3 consultancy, Bud Light went on to put Noun glasses on cans and let holders of its own NFTs vote in the Nouns DAO on its behalf. The Super Bowl cameo wouldn’t scream “NFT” to anyone who didn’t know its origins, but the alliance showed the potential for major brands to embrace Web3 collaboration in a meaningful way.\nRecord-breaking CryptoPunks sale\nThe NFT market was still surging earlier this year, and while we didn’t see any sales on the level of Beeple’s record-setting $69 million auction in March 2021, the February sale of a single CryptoPunks NFT for nearly $24 million still turned a lot of heads.\nDeepak Thapliyal, founder and CEO of Web3 startup Chain, purchased the Punk for 8,000 ETH, doubling the previous record for the iconic Ethereum profile picture (PFP) project. In November, he tweeted that he was open to selling the NFT following the collapse of FTX, which impacted Chain, but Thapliyal ultimately decided to keep the crypto status symbol.\nPixelmon reveal gone wrong\nThe NFT market would keep surging for a couple more months, but there was a clear top signal to the speculative madness in February. After collectors spent $70 million snapping up tokenized monsters for Pixelmon—a game that sounded like little more than an unofficial, NFT-infused Pokémon knockoff—the in-game artwork was released. And it was bad.\nThe clunky-looking, boxy monsters bore none of the Pokémon resemblance of Pixelmon’s concept art, instead appearing to be lazily thrown together. Even the founder admitted that the reveal was a “horrible mistake.” Now the NFTs trade for a tiny fraction of the mint price even after new in-game art was released, with a new team trying to create a proper game around it.\nBAYC team buys CryptoPunks\nBored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs made a big splash in the NFT space in March, announcing that it had acquired the influential CryptoPunks IP from Larva Labs, along with its metaverse-centric Meebits avatar IP.\nAD\nAD\nThe move centralized control of the NFT world’s two largest projects under one house, and came following dissatisfaction from some Punks owners over how Larva handled the project. In recent months, Yuga has granted CryptoPunks and Meebits owners IP commercialization rights, similar to the Bored Apes, while working to establish the Punks’ legacy in the art world. Yuga also announced soon after that it had raised $450 million at a $4 billion valuation.\nFree money for Apes\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club continued its expansion in March with the launch of ApeCoin, an Ethereum-based token built for metaverse apps. With a token claim available to owners of Bored Apes and Mutant Apes, NFT owners cashed in big—Bored Ape owners could snag a haul of approximately $80,000 worth of tokens on day one.\nIn an apparent bit of decentralized theater, Yuga Labs said that it didn’t create the token, although the startup and its founders will wind up with nearly a quarter of the total supply once it all vests. ApeCoin’s price has fallen about 85% since its peak, amid the crypto winter, but NFT holders who cashed out quickly scored big on the launch.\nAxie Infinity hacked amid decline\nLast year’s biggest NFT project, Axie Infinity, started 2022 with a whimper: the monster-battling game’s free-to-play ecosystem was struggling, driving both NFT and token prices down dramatically. The cherry on top of the downward spiral was a late March hack that saw some $622 million worth of crypto funds pilfered from the game’s Ethereum sidechain.\nThe Ronin Network hack was pegged on insufficient decentralization, allowing attackers to send fraudulent transactions via its bridge to Ethereum. The U.S. government blamed the attack on North Korea’s infamous Lazarus group. Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis raised $150 million in fresh capital to help fully refund affected users, and about 10% of the stolen funds have thus far been clawed back from hackers via exchanges.\nMoonbirds take flight\nWith the NFT market still soaring, a new player showed that it could make serious waves in April. Proof, a Web3 startup co-founded by tech entrepreneur and VC Kevin Rose, debuted NFT access passes to an exclusive collectors’ community in late 2021, and then parlayed that move into a massive PFP project drop in April with the Ethereum NFT collection, Moonbirds.\nIn just two days, Moonbirds racked up some $280 million worth of primary and secondary trading volume, then raised capital from Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian to build out its Web3 community vision. Proof stirred up controversy by opening up IP commercialization rights to Moonbirds to everyone in August, but it remains one of Web3’s buzziest startups.\nOtherside’s explosive launch\nYuga Labs would soon top the Moonbirds debut with the launch of virtual land deeds for its upcoming Otherside metaverse game, and once more, Bored Ape owners got a free drop of valuable crypto assets. Given how valuable the Ape NFTs became, there was enormous buzz around Otherside, and Bored Apes surged in value beforehand.\nThe drop garnered over $900 million worth of primary and secondary sales in the first couple days, helping to set a single-day trading record for top marketplace OpenSea in the process. But the mint was widely criticized for poor design and for driving up Ethereum gas fees (the price to send transactions on the network), some of which Yuga ultimately refunded, and for Yuga’s “tone deaf” response to complaints.\nNFT speculative bubble starts sinking\nThe Otherside launch was the year’s last truly massive drop, as the bottom fell out of the NFT market soon after amid the wider crypto crash and macroeconomic turmoil. Trading volume has fallen dramatically, with the monthly tally down 88% when comparing November data to January’s, with the number of NFTs sold falling sharply as well.\nAD\nAD\nPrices on top collections have collapsed, as well, with the minimum asking price for a Bored Ape falling from $429,000 worth of ETH in late April to under $60,000 during November. The market is still yielding over half a billion dollars per month in trading volume, and top NFT projects see occasional big-ticket sales, but the buzz has faded.\nMinecraft announces NFT ban\nSome traditional gamers are vocally opposed to NFTs, and that ethos apparently extends to Minecraft developer Mojang and parent company Microsoft. In July, the companies said that they intend to ban NFTs from fan-operated Minecraft servers, as well as ban derivative projects built from Minecraft’s existing game assets.\nThe move immediately put the crosshairs on Polygon-based fan project NFT Worlds, which intended to create a Minecraft server with player-owned NFT land plots. Ultimately, NFT Worlds opted to start fresh and build its own similar game instead. Another major game studio, Rockstar Games, recently said that it will similarly ban NFTs from Grand Theft Auto V servers.\nTwitter scams take over\nFueled by the speculative, FOMO culture around NFTs, social media scams accelerated in 2022. We saw examples on Discord and Instagram, with accounts hijacked to spread scammy links that stole NFTs from users who connected their wallets to them, but the flood of attacks was most apparent on Twitter.\nEarlier in the year, the accounts of verified users (like journalists) were being stolen, rebranded, and used to share scam links, especially around projects like Otherside and Azuki. That trend subsided, and instead attackers started stealing the accounts of prominent creators like Beeple, Nouns, and Limit Break CEO Gabriel Leydon to share similar scams. Firms like MetaMask and OpenSea are trying to fight back, but such attacks are still flooding the space.\nSolana’s major players take off\nThe Solana NFT space continued to solidify into a strong Ethereum rival in 2022, with a pair of prominent projects really taking off: Magic Eden and DeGods. Marketplace Magic Eden took over the Solana space when it launched in late 2021 and rode that momentum into a $1.6 billion valuation in June, fending off OpenSea’s move into Solana and expanding into Ethereum too.\nMeanwhile, NFT profile-picture project DeGods grew from a rocky launch in late 2021 into a true titan across all NFT networks this year. The project’s NFTs became the most valuable on Solana, the community acquired a team in Ice Cube’s BIG3 basketball league, and then it parlayed that hype into the buzzy y00ts project launch this fall.\nBored Ape IP usage expands\nWhile much of the story around Bored Apes this year had to do with rising (and falling) NFT valuation and freebies for holders, another narrative continued forming as NFT holders used their owned Ape imagery to fuel art, projects, and plenty more.\nThe decentralized IP idea saw some early traction last year, but really caught fire in 2022 with high-profile projects like Snoop Dogg and Eminem’s music video and MTV VMAs performance, the launch of Bored Ape-themed restaurants and drink brands, and quite a bit more. The announcements are still coming regularly, but the may change if the market downtrend persists well into 2023.\nEthereum merge reshapes NFT narrative\nThe Ethereum merge proved to be anticlimactic in terms of market impact, but the transition to a dramatically more eco-friendly consensus model brought significant benefits to the perception of the NFT space. Thanks to the merge, the largest NFT blockchain now consumes over 99% less energy than before, due to the elimination of resource-intensive mining.\nAD\nAD\nThe environmental impact of Ethereum NFTs had been one of the biggest complaints from NFT critics up until that point, even when discussing assets minted on eco-friendlier networks. Now that all significant NFT activity takes place on platforms that don’t have an outsized energy hit or carbon footprint, more creators and brands may feel comfortable entering the space.\nBig brands pick Polygon for NFTs\nWhen it comes to major brands entering Web3, no blockchain network did more to aid mainstream adoption in 2022 than Polygon. The Ethereum sidechain network managed to line up brands like Starbucks, Meta, Nike, Reddit, and Disney, all of which are building projects or platforms on top of Polygon.\nTheir collective reach is enormous, and the early results are promising: In October, a Reddit executive said that more than three million of its users had created Polygon wallets to mint its collectible avatar NFTs. Most of those were freebies that don’t have significant value, but it’s still a huge step for onboarding the masses. The Starbucks NFT rewards platform and Meta’s Instagram NFT minting could reach even more people.\nCreator royalties debate rages\nOver the last couple months, the biggest story in NFTs hasn’t been slowing sales, but growing pushback to creator royalties. Royalties—typically a 5% to 10% fee on secondary sales, paid back to the original artist or creator—are seen by many as a key aspect of Web3, ensuring that creators and builders share in the ongoing success of their work.\nBut some marketplaces started ignoring them this summer in a bid to lure traders away from major platforms, and gobbled up enough market share on Solana to convince Magic Eden to make them optional. OpenSea said that it was considering the same kind of move, and quickly faced ample backlash from creators.\nUltimately, OpenSea said that it would continue to enforce royalties, and rival platform X2Y2 followed suit and adopted OpenSea’s new Ethereum enforcement tool. This story isn’t over, however, with new royalties-enforcing NFT standards and tools in the works as creators attempt to protect a key source of revenue in Web3."}, {"date": "2022-12-23 17:00:42", "entity": ["binance", "binance labs", "binance labs", "binance", "outlook india", "tradingview. com", "binance ftx", "binance", "binance", "binance", "binance", "binance", "binance", "bnb", "bnbus tradingview. com", "binance", "binance", "crypto exchange"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Binance has been under intense scrutiny since it released its proof of reserves about a month ago. The crypto exchange had done so in a bid to assure users that all deposited funds were safe and that it was not going to collapse like FTX, but this had backfired spectacularly for the company. As the FUD ramped up, more than $6 billion was withdrawn from the exchange in a matter of days. Now, Binance has come forward to address the most pressing questions from the community.\nBinance Says Assets Are Fully Backed\nIn a blog post published on its website on Friday, Binance addressed the most prominent questions from community members over the last two weeks, and that is whether the exchange had enough funds to back all user deposits.\nBinance said that user assets on the crypto exchange were backed at a 1:1 ratio, which means they would be able to withdraw their coins at any time. The company explained that it does not mix user funds with company funds. “The company’s assets are completely separated from users’ managed assets,” Binance said. “We have enough capital reserves to cover daily operations. And get through any tough cycles.”\nThe crypto exchange further explained that it was not operating using debt. According to the post, Binance makes its profit from transaction fees on its platform, as well as returns on investments made through its investment and acquisitions arm Binance Labs. Binance Labs reportedly has $7.5 billion in total assets under management and has recorded immense returns on investment of 2,100% from the over 200 projects the company has invested in since 2018.\n“Binance will not embezzle users’ funds for any transactions or investments, nor does it have any debts, nor is it on the list of creditors of any company that has recently gone bankrupt. A few negative cases do not represent the entire industry,” the post read.\nBNB price suffers downtrend from FUD | Source: BNBUSD on TradingView.com\nWhy Financial Information Are Not Disclosed\nAnother development in the massive FUD against the crypto exchange had been that its finances were a “black box.” This is because the financial information of the company has not been disclosed, and Binance addresses the reason why it is so.\nSince it is a private company and not a listed company, it is not obligated to disclose its financial obligation. It further adds that since the company does not need any external financing, nor does it have external investors, its financial history can be kept private. Add in the fact that Binance does not plan to go public, it can continue to operate the way it is as long as it remains self-sufficient.\nI”n many jurisdictions where we operate, we have shared or are sharing operational and financial information as required by local regulators,” Binance revealed. “Some typically require a disclosure process of up to six months due to the sheer volume of information.”\nAs for its audit, Binance had previously stated it was looking for auditors to work with but the Big Four did not want to work with a private crypto company. These traditional accounting firms have a hard time verifying the reserve assets because the exchanges are encrypted. Also, the largely unregulated landscape of the crypto industry has also served to scare them away for fear of regulatory scrutiny and lawsuits.\nFeatured image from Outlook India, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-23 17:00:30", "entity": ["ftt", "ftt", "ftx", "ftx", "bankman - fried", "ftx", "ftx", "ftx", "sb", "tradingview. com", "alameda research", "ftx", "ftx", "bitcoinist", "tradingview. com", "ftx token"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive"], "content": "FTX Token (FTT) saw massive gains on Thursday as news of former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried making bail spread across the space. The rapid uptick in the price of the token showed the positivity, albeit brief, that had spread across investors in the token.

However this was achieved, Sam was released under house arrest.\nSoon after the news broke, the price of FTX’s native token FTT made a significant jump. After trending just below $1 for the better part of the week, the 65% push had brought it above $1.1. This brought renewed vigor to the market and momentum rightfully picked up.\nFTT price spikes following SBF making bail | Source: FTTUSD on TradingView.com\nThe problem now is that FTT has not done a good job of holding onto these gains. Naturally, the brief surge in price had triggered sell-offs among investors looking to take out some profit, triggering another fall below $1. In the early hours of Friday, there had been a 9% jump that brought FTT’s price above $1 once more, but even this would not hold.\nSupport remains weak at $1 and it is now a battle between the bears and the bulls to turn this critical level in their favor. Right now, the bears remain in control of the digital asset with the price sitting at $0.96, and FTT has struggled to break the resistance mounting at $1.\nWhat About FTX?\nFor many in the space who lost money when the FTX crypto exchange collapsed, this is just the beginning of the battle. Charges have already been brought against Bankman-Fried and his associates in what is being called the ‘largest fraud of the generation’ but there is still a long way to go.\nOn Thursday, it was reported that Paul Hastings LLP had been appointed by a committee to represent the interests of creditors in the FTX bankruptcy case. So far, the new FTX CEO John J. Ray III said he and his team had been able to recover around $1 billion worth of assets.\nFormer Alameda Research executive Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang have already pled guilty to fraud charges and agreed to work with authorities. Both have been released on $250,000 bonds with travel restrictions.\nAs the FTX case develops, it is expectedly going to have a big impact on the price movements of FTT tokens. Given this, investors should exercise caution when investing and trading the cryptocurrency.\nFeatured image from Bitcoinist, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-23 17:00:00", "entity": ["bitcoin", "cbdc", "bitcoin", "cbdc", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "central bank", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "central bank digital currencies", "cbdc", "cbdc", "cbdc", "bitcoin", "central bank digital currencies", "central banks", "cbdc", "central bank", "cbdc", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoins", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Bitcoin is a decentralised network that allows anyone to transact with anyone else. CBDCs are issued by a central bank and have controls built into them. Bitcoin offers freedom while CBDCs offer total control.\nThere is much at stake as world economies look for a way out of the desperate plight that a fiat-backed monetary system has driven them into. Central banks believe that their own digital currencies will put economies back on track. Here are 3 reasons why Bitcoin is eminently preferable.\nDecentralisation\ndecentralised control is a key feature of Bitcoin and other decentralised digital currencies. In a decentralised system, control is distributed among multiple parties rather than being concentrated in a single entity. This means that no single entity has the power to make decisions or exert control over the system.\nIn the case of Bitcoin, the decentralised control is achieved through the use of a decentralised network of computers, known as nodes, which validate and record transactions on the blockchain. The blockchain is a decentralised, distributed ledger that records all transactions made on the Bitcoin network. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain in a block, which is then added to the chain of blocks that make up the blockchain.\nBecause the blockchain is decentralised and distributed, it is not controlled by any single entity. Instead, it is maintained by a network of users who contribute their computing resources to the network. This decentralised structure makes it difficult for any single entity to manipulate the network or the information stored on the blockchain.\nIn contrast, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are issued and controlled by central banks, which are typically government-controlled financial institutions. This means that CBDCs are subject to the policies and decisions of those central banks, and the central banks have the ability to exert control over the issuance and use of CBDCs.\nLimited Supply\nOne of the key features of bitcoin is that it has a limited supply of 21 million coins. This limit is built into the bitcoin blockchain, which is the underlying technology that supports the bitcoin network. This means that no matter how much demand there is for bitcoin, the total number of bitcoins that will ever exist is fixed at 21 million.\nThe limited supply of bitcoin is intended to help protect the value of the currency. Inflation occurs when the supply of a currency increases faster than the demand for it, which can lead to a decline in its value. By limiting the supply of bitcoin, its creator hoped to reduce the risk of inflation and protect its value.\nIn contrast, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) are digital versions of traditional fiat currencies, such as the US dollar or the euro. These currencies are issued and backed by central banks, which have the power to create new units of the currency as needed.\nThis means that the supply of CBDCs is not fixed, and the central bank has the ability to increase the supply of the currency if it sees fit. This introduces the risk of inflation if the central bank creates too much of the currency, leading to a decline in its value.\nHigh level of security\nBitcoin uses a combination of advanced cryptographic techniques and a decentralised network to ensure the security of transactions and the integrity of the blockchain.\nThe blockchain is a decentralised ledger that records all bitcoin transactions. Each transaction is verified by a network of computers, called nodes, that work together to validate the transaction and add it to the blockchain.\nThese nodes use cryptographic techniques to ensure that the transaction is legitimate and cannot be altered or tampered with once it is added to the blockchain. This makes it extremely difficult for anyone to fraudulently alter the ledger or steal bitcoins.\nWhile CBDCs may also be secure, there is a risk that they could be vulnerable to cyberattacks. This is because CBDCs rely on a centralised system, which means that there is a single point of failure that could be targeted by hackers.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Shiba Inu(SHIB) is one such canine coin. Shiba Inu (SHIB) has attracted significant internet followers because it is a \"meme coin.\"\nUnfortunately, this hype has not resulted in a significant price point for Shiba Inu (SHIB). It has a price of $0.000008714, a 22% loss in the past three months. Bears still have Shiba Inu (SHIB) in their palm, and an investment in it at this time is not a good idea. According to some analysts, The Hideaways will be a better alternative in 2023.\nPolygon (MATIC) Still Stuck In A Bear Market\nPolygon (MATIC) was developed as a scalable mechanism to address several issues with the blockchain network, notably trading costs. Many blockchain platforms like Avalanche and Polkadot have features that Polygon (MATIC) shares.\nPolygon (MATIC) has had a tough year, as its price dropped by 63% in the last 12 months. And with the 11% weekly fall that occurred, Polygon (MATIC) is a high-risk asset that you should avoid. And investors are also noticing that, putting their funds in The Hideaways.\nThe Hideaways (HDWY) Price Will Drastically Increase\nWhat makes The Hideaways stop going down the road that Polygon (MATIC) and Shiba Inu(SHIB) are now going? Let's take a closer look:\n● The Hideaways will generate an NFT backed by a real property that provides rental income.\n● The Hideaways will deliver passive income to investors through ETH and USDT.\n● All members will be a part of monthly prize drops .\nHave you ever wanted to invest in real estate for just $100? Through The Hideaways, that dream will become a reality. It will create a one-of-a-kind alternative-investment platformallowing individuals to buy and trade fractionalized NFTs backed by luxurious penthouses and mansions.\nThe Hideaways price is currently only $0.10, and it is predicted to rise to $4 by mid-2023.

In a report in the NY Times, he stated, \"The roadway is getting shorter.\"\nAccording to Gensler's estimate, only a small fraction (approximately 0.06%) of the cryptocurrency tokens in circulation are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nInvestors in these tokens do not receive the same level of disclosures as they would with investments in stocks. As a result, the public should be cautious when considering the reported volumes traded and values of these tokens.\nAccording to Gensler, many of the thousands of cryptocurrencies listed on exchanges and tracking websites have low levels of trading activity and are susceptible to manipulation, similar to micro-cap companies (small publicly traded companies with a market capitalization of around $50 million to $300 million).\nGensler suggested that insiders of these projects may try to \"sell the public on an idea while they're potentially fraudulently pumping up the stock,\"\nHe added:\n“This leads to distorted incentives and puts the public further at risk of the token not being properly registered and having proper disclosures and complying with the various provisions of the securities law about anti-fraud and anti-manipulation,”\nGensler expressed support for regulating certain sectors of the cryptocurrency market, such as stablecoins, which are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific asset, like the dollar. These assets often act as a connection between traditional finance and the future of finance, and have gained investor interest and the attention of some traditional finance players.

This is the legislative body that sent the bill to the president on November 29.

This makes Brazil one of the first South American countries to have officially recognized Bitcoin as a medium of payment and even an investment asset. This new bill confirms that the new law defines crypto as “a digital representation of value that can be negotiated or transferred electronically and used for payments or as an investment.”\nAdditionally, it mentions:\nIt will be incumbent upon a body or entity of the federal public administration, defined in an act of the Executive Branch, to establish which financial assets will be regulated for the purposes of this law.\nHow Soon Is The Law Going Into Effect?\nThe Central Bank of Brazil (BCB) will supposedly supervise Bitcoin’s payment usage, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) will be looking into investments related to cryptocurrencies.\nThis crypto law is expected to go into effect 180 days from the day it was passed; however, it is to be remembered that Bitcoin is not considered a legal tender in Brazil as of now.\nThis law has just designated crypto as a form of payment, but in addition to this, the law mandates exchanges to make a transparent distinction between company and user funds.

The complaint from that time alleges that Emergent Fidelity Technologies \"has custody of the collateral that belongs to BlockFi.\"\nThough the latest filing claims that these shares actually belong to the bankruptcy estate, it argues instead that due to this list of creditors, the court should hold off on any distribution of these shares.\n\"The Court need find only that the Robinhood Shares are 'arguably' estate property, which requires a finding that Alameda has 'arguable claims of right to the [Robinhood Shares], or a colorable basis for asserting an interest in the [Robinhood Shares].'”\nThis \"colorable\" claim, the filing argues, is enough that the $450 million in Robinhood shares should \"remain frozen.\""}, {"date": "2022-12-23 13:00:39", "entity": ["metaone", "coinbase pay", "coinbase pay", "metaone wallet", "ftx", "metaone", "aag", "aag", "metaone wallet", "metaverse", "metaone wallet", "metaone", "metaone", "aag", "aag", "aag", "aag", "metaone wallet", "aag", "aag", "metaverse", "aag", "sg", "chainwire", "aag", "coinbase pay", "metaone wallet", "metaone wallet", "aag"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Singapore, SG, 23rd December, 2022, Chainwire\nAAG, a web3 infrastructure company, has integrated Coinbase Pay to enhance the fiat on-ramping features of its new user focused MetaOne Wallet.

The 30-year-old crypto whizz is accused of mismanaging billions in customer funds at FTX.\nA New York federal judge ruled on Thursday that FTX founder SBF will be released on a $250 million bond while he awaits trial for fraud related to his collapsed crypto empire. Per reports by CNBC and Reuters, SBF’s bail was secured by his parents Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, who offered up their home in Palo Alto, California as collateral. This essentially means that since Bankman-Fried’s parents signed the bond agreement, they would be liable for $250 million should their son decide to flee. Many have wondered how SBF, or his parents, in fact, could afford bail as Bankman-Fried said in late November that he now had “close to nothing” left and has one remaining credit card with “maybe $100,000 in that bank account.”\nLargest Bail in White Collar History\nIt is no surprise that SBF received bail as he is accused of committing a white collar, or financial crime. New York federal prosecutors have indicated SBF’s alleged crimes and the collapse of FTX as one of the largest financial frauds in the history of the United States, and his bond package understandably far exceeds some of the most notorious white-collar cases in that history. Reuters reports that one prominent New York bail bondsman who specializes in high-profile defendants said, “It’s the largest bond I’ve ever heard of in my history of doing bonds.”\nOne of the most prolific financial crimes in history – the $65 billion Ponzi scheme in which Bernard Madoff was at the helm, saw him released in 2008 on a $10 million bond. Madoff was ordered to surrender his passport and had to consent to strict monitoring conditions.\nA more recent scandal saw Elizabeth Holmes, founder of blood testing startup Theranos, who was convicted of defrauding investors, released after her arrest in 2018 on a $500,000 bail bond after she was also required to surrender her passport.\nBail Conditions See SBF Surrender His Passport\nAs is common in accused crimes of this nature, defendants typically are required to surrender their passports and must wear monitoring devices. SBF’s bail package is not different. Prosecutor Nicolas Roos told U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein that as part of the conditions of his bail, SBF would have to hand over his passport and will see him confined to his parent’s home.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

By launching NTO Collection Choise.com sets out to introduce new mechanics that will fundamentally change the distribution market for tokens and NFTs.\nNTO is a new type of token distribution that introduces a new asset class concept - overcollateralized NFTs. Each NFT offered via Choise.com NTO is backed by the company’s native CHO tokens that are already actively traded on exchanges. This means that each NFT has actual value behind it. In addition to the tokens, a large number of gifts and prizes, whereby the prize pool is $5 million, are hidden in NFTs.\nChoise.com is a leading earning marketplace that has been around since 2017. It offers a unified ecosystem where people can easily find and make use of various financial solutions to earn on their digital assets. This allows Choise.com clients the chance to select the most promising products and enjoy high returns from their investments without having to delve too deep into technical details.\nNow Choise.com sets out to change the distribution market for tokens and NFTs. The Chobies NTO Collection is the first in the upcoming line of Choise.com NTO products. It embodies an interesting trend that might pick up in the crypto market over time.\nChoby NFTs come with a lot of features – almost a quarter of them come with perks. For example, users can win from 25 to 100,000 USDT in Choby NFTs or get cashback of up to 100%. Users also have a chance to get one of Choise.com's plastic and metal crypto cards inside a Choby NFT. Also, over 30 million CHO tokens have a 0-12 months lockup period, and vesting period is 0-36 months. However, you can mint a Choby NFT with a shorter or no period at all.\nThe NTO launch will be taking place in 6 stages, and the amount of offered NFTs will grow with each of them. Minting an NFT starts at $150 and grows at each stage by $50. Users can mint a Choby NFT, with thousands of CHO tokens inside. Notably, 1000 CHO cost $850 at the time of writing.\nUntil now the value of NFTs was hard to assess, and their price could fluctuate wildly as a result. With Chobies, investors acquire NFTs that are backed by tokens with real value. Monitoring the rate of CHO allows them to estimate the viability of their investments. In the long term, this can become a great way for companies to expand their operations and grow their shareholder base.\nNFTs represent a good tool for the tokenization of various creative and financial assets. And Choise.com NTO can help establish a new industry standard where companies with good tokenomics can raise the necessary funds to develop their own products while catering to the desires of market players. As a result, everyone stands to benefit.\nVisit the Choise.com website for more information on how to take part in this exciting opportunity here .\nAbout Choise.com\nChoise.com is a crypto firm that combines the best of the CeFi and DeFi worlds.

The feature makes each transaction more transparent and helps users to understand the eUTxO mechanism much better.\nThe blockchain explorer created by Peter Oravec is not something that most crypto enthusiasts and users got used to as it acts more like a blockchain visualizer, showing what transaction each block includes. With the new feature, you will be able to access the inputs/outputs of transactions with one click, and it does not matter if it is an NFT or a regular transfer.\nInputs and outputs are the backbone of the UTXO accounting model that Cardano utilizes and promotes. Within this model, transactions act to unlock previous outputs and create new ones.\nA transaction's output includes an address and a value, sealed by the signature belonging to an address. After unlocking it, the output can be turned into input and consumed by a new transaction. After they produce new outputs, they get consumed by future transfers.\nA transaction input is the output of a previous transaction, as mentioned above. It includes a pointer and a signature that unlocks it. The pointer's main function is to show the previous transaction output, which moves the chain.\nWith the solution developed by Oravec, users will be able to see exact outputs and inputs on the network, easily accessing all necessary data for breaking down certain transactions.\nWith the help of solutions similar to Oravec, Cardano's ecosystem is becoming more robust and developed.

And the chances are high!\nBitcoin price has been heavily dependent on macro data and the decisions of the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) lately. The last FOMC meeting of the year on December 13 provided a bearish surprise, even though the consumer price index (CPI) came in better than expected.\nHowever, there was a catch. After the FOMC meeting, rumors emerged that chairman Jerome Powell ignored the CPI data that arrived a few hours before the meeting, although he claimed the opposite in the press conference. Within Wall Street, several analysts spoke out, accusing Powell of hoaxes.\nWhy Today’s Core PCE Is Of Paramount Importance\nThe problem is that the Fed’s forecast for core PCE inflation seems far too high after the surprisingly weak CPI data, as Tomas Lee, an analyst at Fundstrat, writes.\nAs the economic forecast overview shows, the FED raised the core PCE inflation target for 2022 from 4.5% to 4.8%. With that, Powell added to the “higher for longer” narrative. But there is something “odd,” as Lee explained. The month-to-month percentage change in inflation would have to be staggeringly high to reach the FED’s 4.8% target.\nLee wonders how the FED can forecast 4.8% core PCE inflation in 2022 when inflation is moving toward 4.1-4.2%. “How can Fed forecast be so far??” Lee wrote.\nThe analyst points to a ransomware attack on Haver Analytics as a possible reason for this large divergence. Due to the attack, Haver Analytics may not have been able to update the data, which is why Jerome Powell and the FOMC committee ignored the positive data.\nTherefore, according to the Fundstrat analyst, today’s PCE release is of massive importance. Lee writes:\nWe think core PCE inflation will be 0.10% compared to Cleveland Fed inflation NOW forecast of 0.26%. Any figure below 0.40% would make #FOMC figure of 4.8% too high.\nRemarkably, the PCE is also the key data point for the U.S. central bank. The FED’s forecasts and its 2% target are not based on CPI, but on the PCE. Twitter user ZeroHedge estimated based on this fact:\nIf tomorrow’s core PCE is 4.5% or lower (~75% chance), the entire hawkish FOMC repricing is blown out – no way 4.8% core PCE in December, SEP/Dots repriced and terminal rate tumbles.\nThe Impact On The Bitcoin Price\nIf the PCE is significantly below the FED’s expectations, the theory would find confirmation today and could completely wipe out the bearish sentiment. The FED would possibly be forced to revise its forecasts as the PCE shows that inflation is under control.\nThis could prompt the FED to take a more dovish stance at the next meeting, with markets front-running this as early as today. Ultimately, the PCE release could lead to a weaker dollar, spurring risk assets like Bitcoin.\nAt press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $16,827. Today, like the last few days, the $16,900 level will be of key importance as the most crucial resistance at the moment.\nIf there is a strong push above this resistance, the next target would be the $17,400 region. Otherwise, Bitcoin investors should keep an eye on the support at $16,400.\nFeatured image from Traxer / Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-23 10:05:00", "entity": ["ripple", "t. co", "ripple", "u.", "twitter", "filan", "filan", "ripple", "sec", "ripple", "filan", "dropbox", "ripple labs", "ripple"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "According to recently published tweet, Ripple has decided to seal some crucial documentation it first filed several months ago\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

Both parties met that deadline in a timely manner. And the SEC’s filing reveals that it is still not ready to release the Hinman documents to the public.\nIn the document, the SEC is begging district judge Analisa Torres not to release the documents, while also issuing a threat:\nThe SEC respectfully maintains that the Hinman Speech Documents are protected by privilege. But if these documents were to become part of the public record, the SEC would be foreclosed from making any such argument in the future (on appeal in this litigation or in other litigation), which would be highly prejudicial to the SEC.\nIs Ripple Becoming The SEC’s Nemesis?\nRipple community attorney Jeremy Hogan commented on this paragraph in the document: “The SEC is STILL arguing that the Hinman emails are privileged despite losing that issue about 100 times already. Blows my mind. AND makes me recurious (is that a word?) about what is in them.”\nAnother community lawyer, Bill Morgan, points out the threat the SEC is making. According to the SEC, Torres is not authorized to release the Hinman documents because they could appeal the summary judgment decision.\nUltimately, the agency argues that it did not waive the privilege against the public because it turned the emails over to Ripple as ordered. “I’m not sure how the SEC can argue that it didn’t waive the privilege when the court has determined that they are not privileged,” Morgan noted.\nFurther, the attorney contended that under the court’s findings, there is no privilege that can or cannot be waived. At the same time, Morgan concedes legitimacy to the SEC’s argument because the SEC could still appeal. This does not definitively settle the confidentiality issue.\n“It is not a question of the value of the decision in this case as a precedent but a question of res judicata,” Morgan said.\nStill, the SEC’s statement makes clear that Hinman is paramount to its “law by enforcement” policy. Another victory for Ripple at this point could be a victory for the entire crypto industry.\nBack in late September, Judge Torres ruled that the Hinman documents must be turned over to Ripple Labs after months of litigation. The documents, authored by former SEC Corporation Finance Division Director William Hinman, primarily relate to a speech the executive gave at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit in June 2018.\nHinman stated in his speech that Ethereum (ETH) is not a security. Ripple considers the speech a key piece of evidence to prove the ambiguous legal regime for crypto in the U.S. – which even SEC employees can’t navigate.\nThe statement that the “SEC would be foreclosed from making any such argument in the future” reveal the massive implications.\nAt press time, the XRP price was trading at $0.3494.\nFeatured image from Fox Business, Charts from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-23 08:27:00", "entity": ["ftx", "nft", "solana", "##ereum", "delphi digital", "solana", "ethereum", "solana", "ethereum", "solana", "solana", "ethereum", "sol", "solana", "sol", "solana", "ethereum", "ethereum", "twitter. com", "delphi digital", "solana"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Disclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

In the two years since, none have emerged.\nIn August, a British court ruled that Wright submitted “deliberately false” evidence in a defamation case he filed against Peter McCormack, a podcaster who repeatedly called Wright a “fraud” for claiming to be Satoshi.\nThe court determined that McCormack’s tweets caused serious harm to Wright’s reputation, but the judge ultimately awarded Wright damages of £1, stating it would be “unconscionable” for Wright to receive anything more after submitting false evidence.\nWright first gained notoriety in 2015, after a Wired article argued the computer scientist invented Bitcoin by citing blog posts by Wright that discussed the cryptocurrency days before its beta release in 2009. Wright then came forward and confirmed that he was in fact Satoshi. But evidence from the Wayback Machine soon thereafter revealed that the blog post may have actually been written years later, in 2013 or 2014, and backdated.\nWired backtracked, stating it now doubted Wright’s story, and considered it a potential “hoax.”\nThe intervening years saw Wright file a litany of lawsuits against a number of crypto leaders who publicly doubted his story. Most were dropped, dismissed, or ultimately unsuccessful. One of the last of those suits, against crypto influencer Hodlonaut, saw some resolution in October when a Norwegian court determined that Hodlonaut did not defame Wright when he called him a “pathetic scammer” who was “clearly mentally ill” and a “fraud.”\nAD\nAD\nWright, tweeting Wednesday, did not appear to surrender his claims to inventing Bitcoin, characterizing anyone who doubted his identity and story as “[t]hose seeking greed,” who “loathe all bitcoin stands for and seek to twist it.”\nBut years of public and legal skepticism of Wright appear to have made an impact.\n“I no longer care what you think,” Wright wrote. “I seek to see my creation used. The rest is no longer important.”\nIf his goal truly is Bitcoin’s adoption, Wright’s days of anger should soon be behind him."}, {"date": "2022-12-23 02:09:24", "entity": ["binance", "coinbase pro", "kucoin", "zachxbt", "3commas", "3commas", "##xbt", "bear market", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "u. s. secret service", "coinmamba", "twitter", "3commas", "decrypt", "3commas", "pena", "3commas", "twitter", "coinmamba", "coinmamba", "binance", "coinmamba", "3commas", "3commas", "twitter", "youtube", "t. co", "kv 3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "sorokin", "3commas", "io", "ftx", "ftx", "3commas", "binance", "web3", "twitter", "youtube", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "google", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "google", "telegram group", "decryp", "##f 3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "3commas", "t. co", "3commas", "google"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Despite the bear market, cryptocurrency day traders still see opportunities to strike it rich.

APIs are used for various reasons, providing a way for developers to access multiple services and data, and enabling users to interact with different applications through a single user interface.\nWhat is algorithmic trading?\nAlgorithmic trading uses computer programs, including APIs, to execute trades in financial markets. These programs, also known as trading bots, are designed to analyze market conditions and execute trades triggered by predefined parameters.\nOne advantage of algorithmic trading is that it allows traders to execute trades quickly without human interaction. Trading bots can be especially useful in fast-moving global markets like cryptocurrency, where manual trading may not be possible.\nWhile algorithmic trading bots can help traders looking for an edge, their use also carries risks, such as potential errors or malfunctions in the algorithm or compromised access to their settings.\nAn earlier 3Commas scam\nIn October 2022, then-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried paid out $6 million to FTX traders who were victims of a multimillion-dollar scam, He tweeted that he was prepared to remunerate FTX users affected by a phishing exploit involving 3Commas, but warned that the action should not be considered a precedent or company policy.\nHe asserted: \"We will not making a habit of compensating for uses getting phished by fake versions of other companies!\"\n13) But in this particular case, we will compensate the affected users.

But 3Commas says the theft of user funds was due to a phishing attack, not their software, and called the claims of API leaks or exploits—then and now—fake and spread by bad actors.\nThere have been some false rumors shared by bad faith actors using falsified evidence to claim 3Commas leaked users’ API keys. These rumors were related to fake screenshots of Cloudflare logs that have been shared on Twitter and Youtube.\nThe full article: https://t.co/KVOF2BWlYn pic.twitter.com/qJ52CvnVg0 — 3Commas (@3commas_io) December 11, 2022\nThe issue is not about 3Commas API, it is about the safety of API keys of the users stored on 3Commas platform,\" Sorokin tweeted. \"And these API keys are safe.\"\nAD\nAD\nIn a series of blog posts posted to the 3Commas website, Sorokin has repeatedly addressed the claims against the platform.\n\"In the latest edition to this saga of API keys and attacks on exchanges, we're now seeing individuals on Twitter and YouTube circulating fake screenshots of Cloudflare logs in an attempt to convince people that there was a vulnerability within 3Commas and that we were irresponsible enough to allow open access to user data and log files,\" Sorokin wrote, pointing to a December 10, 2022 tweet that he says claims 3Commas employees are stealing API keys.\n3commas @CoinDesk @CryptoAmb @SShillsalot @coinmamba @Shaifing 3commas employees are stealing the API keys\nI attached the screenshots from the Cloudflare that shows 3commas dashboard and how API keys are exposed there.

Around that same time, Pena says he launched his business, Crypto Trading Desk.\nAD\nAD\nMundy says he has used 3Commas' API on multiple portfolios for just under two years without issue; he first noticed problems with his trading account during the Thanksgiving holiday in November 2022.\n\"I had an API with trade-enabled access to my portfolio,\" he said. \"My greatest fear was realized on Thanksgiving morning when I started seeing 1000s of trade alerts happening on my portfolio.\" Pena said he deleted the API before the thieves drained all of his funds.\nMundy took to Google to research what happened to him and found that he was not the only one to experience what he did. Pena says he is working with others who say the same thing happened to them.\nSo far, Mundy claims to have had face-to-face interviews with nearly 60 individual users who report unauthorized transactions using 3Commas’ API.\nHe adds that several of the people he spoke with have taken the step of going to law enforcement about the matter. Using his background in cybersecurity forensics, Mundy says he was able to reverse engineer the attack on his account. He then took that information to contacts in the U.S. Secret Service.\nIn December 2022, a crypto trader who goes by CoinMamba took to Twitter to say that their Binance was compromised due to a leak of the 3Commas API key, which led them to lose funds.\nHey guys. Unfortunately two days ago my Binance account got exploited through an API which I’ve created 2 years ago and haven’t used since which I assumed I deleted but apparently didn’t. It was used to make trades on low cap coins to push up the price to make profit. — CoinMamba (@coinmamba) December 8, 2022\nThe tweet led to several exchanges between CoinMamba and Binance CEO Changpeng \"CZ\" Zhao, which ended with CoinMamba's Binance account being closed.\n\"The only common denominator here is 3Commas,\" Mundy said.\nThough Mundy is confident that there is an issue with 3Commas software, he did acknowledge that some of the problems stem from traders forgetting about and leaving APIs attached to their accounts.\nAD\nAD\n\"Most people forget,\" he said. \"Setting up APIs isn't something that you do quite often. Most people have only ever had one API associated with their portfolio.\" Mundy tells Decrypt other affected traders are also looking at their legal options and are working with law enforcement.\nEditors note: This article has been updated to clarify that the API keys involved were issued by exchanges, and to further incorporate responses Sorokin published on Twitter."}, {"date": "2022-12-23 01:00:00", "entity": ["ltc", "litecoin", "ema", "terra luna", "ftx", "hideaways", "litecoin", "litecoin", "shiba inu", "hideaways", "litecoin", "hideaways", "hideaways", "litecoin", "ftx", "hideaways", "litecoin", "litecoin", "register telegram"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Litecoin (LTC) went against all odds when it pulled a bull run whilst the FTX crashed.

That action follows a plethora of past moves taken by the securities regulator. But the complaint’s language regarding FTT went notably further.\nWednesday’s complaint labeled FTT “an illiquid crypto asset security,” making the subtle—but crucial—point that the SEC views FTT as a security in itself, regardless of the manner in which it was offered or sold. SEC chair Gary Gensler doubled down on that view yesterday while announcing the charges against Ellison and Wang, calling FTT “an exchange crypto security token that was integral to FTX.”\nWhile seemingly semantic, the difference between pursuing an action against a company for offering an asset as a security, and labeling an asset inherently a security in all contexts, marks a shift in the SEC’s decades-long approach to security regulation. The change could mean a potentially substantial escalation in the agency’s efforts to regulate the crypto industry.\nIf the SEC can get courts to agree that crypto tokens like FTT are securities regardless of how they are offered, the agency would be able to go after more than just the projects that create those tokens. The SEC could target any intermediary that sells those tokens in any context. In such a scenario, major crypto exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Binance would be exposed to immense legal liability, and either permitted to participate in crypto-wary registered exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, or shut down.\nLast month, the SEC defeated blockchain-based publishing platform LBRY in federal court, and got a judge to imply in his ruling that LBRY’s native token LBC could be considered a security.\nAD\nAD\n“What the LBRY decision does is provide a major step forward in the SEC’s quest to label all tokens as securities, and that is indeed a very, very significant thing,” Lewis Cohen, an attorney specializing in crypto and securities regulation, told Decrypt at the time. (Cohen has previously represented Decrypt.)\n“The SEC has changed gears,” Cohen said. “Instead of going after projects, they want to go after the marketplaces and intermediaries.”\nThe SEC’s victory against LBRY, though, occurred in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, a jurisdiction without major sway on federal jurisprudence. The SEC’s current case against FTX, meanwhile, is set in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, the Manhattan-based overseer of Wall Street activity so central to federal finance law that it is regularly referred to as the “Mother Court” by legal professionals.\nPrior to FTX’s stunning collapse last month, the next hurdle in the SEC’s apparent quest to take on crypto exchanges looked to be winning its prominent, ongoing case against blockchain payments company Ripple Labs. Experts pondered whether the federal agency would be able to get a judge from the Southern District of New York in that case to label Ripple’s XRP token an inherent security.\nThere will be no such anticipation hanging over the SEC’s case against FTX; Ellison and Wang have already pled guilty to all charges."}, {"date": "2022-12-22 20:42:37", "entity": ["sbf", "new york times", "sbf", "sbf", "ftx sbf", "ftx", "ftx", "trading", "alameda research", "ftx", "ethereum", "ftx sbf", "ftx", "sbf", "stanford.", "u. s. securities and exchange commission", "ftx", "alameda", "ftt", "sbf", "bitcoini ftx", "sbf"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman Fried (SBF) had his first appearance in court following his extradition from the Bahamas.

The FTX executives confessed to his participation in a scheme to commit market manipulation and misuse their clients’ funds.\nAccording to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC):\n(…) Ms. Ellison and Mr. Wang played an active role in a scheme to misuse FTX customer assets to prop up Alameda and to post collateral for margin trading. When FTT and the rest of the house of cards collapsed, Mr. Bankman-Fried, Ms. Ellison, and Mr. Wang left investors holding the bag.\nSam Bankman-Fried’s parents secured the $250 million bail and committed to his court appearances. In addition, SBF had to surrender his passport, and the court will track his mobility with a bracelet.\nIf SBF fails to meet these requirements, the court will immediately order his arrest, and his parents will be held responsible. Per the New York Times, the U.S. prosecutors in the Southern District of New York proposed the deal.\nLawyers Mark Cohen and Christian Everderll are representing SBF; they claim that their client will remain with his parents:\nMy client voluntarily consented to come to face these charges here in New York.

NFTs are most commonly attached to digital art, but can be linked to other digital media like movies, music, TV shows, or real-world assets.\nCreator royalties are fees associated with the sale of NFTs, typically between 5% and 10% of the sale price, paid by the seller to the original creators of a given NFT project.\n\"The fact that the early NFT wave touted royalties is such a strong feature,\" Horne said. \"And it did work for some time, but has led us to this moment right now where the actual functionality of those royalties is being challenged in practice.

Similar to OpenSea's, the new protocol allows NFT creators to block marketplaces that won't honor royalty fees on eligible assets.\n\"I think the moment we're in now is, how can we start to think of new royalty models that don't rely on secondary trading, but actually start to allow artists to retain ownership of the collection themselves up front,\" Horne said, going on to suggest that artists should hold back a percentage of the supply for themselves as a possible solution.\n\"I'm very sympathetic to the artist side because it was one of the largest selling points, and now that's being challenged.\"\nListen and subscribe to the gm podcast wherever you get your podcasts.\nAD\nAD"}, {"date": "2022-12-22 18:08:22", "entity": ["gold bug", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "gold", "bitcoin", "gold", "bitcoin", "gold", "bitcoin", "td ameritrade network", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The gold bug has stressed that Bitcoin owners should “get out” before it’s too late\nIn a tweet posted on Thursday, renowned economist and Bitcoin skeptic Peter Schiff slammed the so-called \"Bitcoin HODL gang\" for accusing him of not understanding Bitcoin.\nSchiff referenced the \"HODL\" acronym popularized in many crypto memes, which stands for \"Hold On for Dear Life.\" The economist took a jab at those who bought crypto assets at high prices but are sitting on them instead of taking a loss.

Several crypto exchanges proposed to release proof-of-reserves to offer customers reassurance that their funds are safe and to prove that the firm is financially healthy and stable.\nThe SEC’s Acting Chief Accountant Paul Munter told the WSJ:\nWe’re warning investors to be very wary of some of the claims that are being made by crypto companies.\nSEC Heightens its Scrutiny of Audit Reports\nThe SEC holds by its anti-crypto stance and has systematically increased its monitoring of companies involved with digital assets as the industry continues to grow. As crypto firms now are being forced to reveal the state of their finances, the SEC has decided to look more closely at how cryptocurrency firms portray their reports from audit firms. As regulatory pressure surrounding cryptocurrencies remains a grey area, banks and auditing firms have been reluctant to work with crypto firms.\nThe most recent example of this saw France-based firm Mazars temporarily suspend its auditing services to Binance, Crypto.com, and KuCoin. Mazars even went as far as to remove the link to Binance’s proof-of-reserve assessment from its website after it found the exchange’s Bitcoin reserves to be overcollateralized. Bloomberg was the first to report that Mazars had suspended its services to the aforementioned crypto firms and further reported that other auditing firms such as FTX’s auditor Armanino also halted their work with crypto exchanges such as OKX and Gate.io.\nThe SEC is for this reason sending warnings to audit firms working on crypto audits as it believes crypto exchanges are using proof-of-reserve reports from audit firms for their benefit. The danger in this the SEC believes is that it contains limited financial details to assess whether a company does have sufficient assets to cover its liabilities.\nGary Gensler: Investors Remain Exposed to Crypto Risks\nChair of the SEC, Gary Gensler, stated investors remain exposed to the risks surrounding the crypto industry until these firms comply with time-tested securities laws. Gensler was speaking in response to the agency’s charges of fraud against former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang. Gensler added that it remains a priority for the agency to use all tools at its disposal to bring the cryptocurrency industry into compliance.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Bankman-Fried said later that “that is definitely not true,” adding that he didn’t “know exactly what they’re [Reuters] referring to.”\nIt now appears that this code indeed existed and offered Alameda some serious benefits. It let the trading firm run a negative balance in its account on FTX, provided the firm with “a virtually unlimited ‘line of credit,’” and prevented Alameda from ever being liquidated.\nImportantly, both Ellison and Wang acknowledged the existence of these privileges and that Alameda was an exclusive beneficiary of them.\n“Defendants were also both aware that the existence of these special privileges, which were put in place at Bankman-Fried’s direction, were hidden from FTX’s investors,” reads the SEC’s complaint.\nAD\nAD\nUnlimited ‘line of credit’\nThe complaint alleges that the source of Alameda’s “line of credit” was pulled from FTX users thanks to the above-mentioned backdoor code—routed via a series of interconnected subsidiaries, notably one such firm called North Dimension.\nUsers deposited fiat into what they thought was FTX but were often actually bank accounts controlled by Alameda. In exchange for these deposits, users would receive “e-money” which, according to FTX’s terms of service, users could “redeem all or part of” at any time.\nAnother key component of the scheme was how this line of credit was labeled. Called “fiat@ftx.com” in the FTX database, it had no connection to Alameda and allowed Alameda to hide this essentially bottomless liability when courting additional loans.\nThe complaint explains that Ellison and Wang \"knew that FTX customer funds were being sent to Alameda-controlled bank accounts and that Alameda’s liability was reflected in the ‘fiat@ftx.com’ account.”\nIn total, more than $8 billion in FTX customer assets were handed over to Alameda this way to pay back outstanding loans made to the trading firm and fund its trading strategies.\nFTT token 'a security'\nThe asset, which was arguably the first domino to topple the FTX empire, played a key role in the FTX and Alameda operation.\nThe FTT token was propped up by Ellison’s trading activity under “the direction of Bankman-Fried” to inflate the token’s value and allow Alameda to continue borrowing against it. And though she was actively manipulating the price of the token, the token’s supply remained almost exclusively in the hands of the two firms.\n“Defendants and Bankman-Fried knew or were reckless in not knowing, if Alameda or FTX tried to sell Alameda’s [FTT] holdings, market prices for the tokens would fall, thereby driving down the value of Alameda’s deposited collateral at FTX,” the complaint reads.\nThe complaint continues, defining the FTT token as a security, citing that sales of the token were used to fund FTX’s growth and operations. During the token’s Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), investors were told that the token would be listed at $1, but if they bought it ahead of time, they could scoop up the token at a hefty discount of up to $0.10.\nAs a refresher, here’s how the Howey Test defines a security: \"investment of money in a common enterprise with a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the efforts of others.\"\nAD\nAD\nCommingled all the way through\nIf it wasn’t already clear, claims made by Sam Bankman-Fried that there was a clear separation between the two firms were quite clearly “false or misleading.”\nEach instance of commingling, though often executed or designed by Ellison and Wang, respectively, was primarily done under “Bankman-Fried’s direction.”\nEven after Sam Trabucco and Ellison became co-CEOs of Alameda, Bankman-Fried still maintained full access to the trading firm’s records and databases, overseeing its investments and operations.\nAnd just as much of the responsibility falls on a single actor, so too were assets and liabilities from both firms treated as one big “personal piggy bank,” whether known or recklessly unknown."}, {"date": "2022-12-22 17:00:45", "entity": ["coinbase", "cardano", "exchange", "binance", "kraken", "coinbase", "tron dao", "wintermute", "tron dao reserve", "ftx", "alameda research", "ftx", "tradingview. com", "stablecoins", "wintermute", "ftx", "wintermute", "wintermute", "wintermute", "wintermute", "wintermute", "twitter", "twitter", "wintermute"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "Wintermute, a cryptocurrency trading firm, made headlines in September 2022 when it suffered a massive $160 million hack.

However, not everyone believes that the company is completely out of the woods.\nThe Wintermute “Dumpster-Fire”\nA now-deleted Twitter thread has accused the Wintermute crypto trading firm of being a “dumpster fire.” The thread which claims to have information from current and ex-employees of the company as well as clients, claims that employees, especially the dev team, are unsatisfied with the company’s leadership and practices.\nSource | Twitter\nFor one, it alleges that the company was losing money to the tune of $50,000-$100,000 per tick and “the systems literally have to be shut off when a large economic event occurs because no one knows how to trade it without losing money.” Additionally, the thread states the Net Trade Income (NTI) which was reported by the company to be $1.05 billion for 2021 was actually $850 million. As well as the $225 million figure reported for the first 9 months of 2021 actually being closer to $100 million.\nRelated Reading: Coinbase’s 2023 Crypto Market Outlook Is Here, But Where Is Cardano?\nFurther claims are that employees were leaving the company at an alarming rate. Apparently, experienced staff were leaving the company as early as one month after they join. But perhaps the most impactful allegation from the Twitter thread was that employee bonuses are not being distributed fairly.\nThey allege that only a tiny fraction of the bonuses (3%) listed for employees in their charter (30%) were being paid while management and the CEO took home a larger share.\nSource | Twitter\nIs The Company In Trouble?\nThe sharp drop in the revenue of Wintermute has been one of the factors that sparked speculations about the health of the company. It had dropped over 78% in the first three quarters of 2022, which was enough to raise eyebrows. However, according to a recent Forbes report, the company is not too worried about this.\nIt says that the company which currently employs around 95 people had $720 million in assets, $400 million in equity and $50 million in VC investments. $350 million of its $400 million in equity is in USDC stablecoins and their debt-to-equity ratio is only 0.8, the company claims.\nEvgeny Gaevoy, CEO of Wintermute, says they’re working harder than ever and the company is preparing for the next bull. “We don’t necessarily care about making the most now because it’ll be just a tiny fraction of the bull markets that can come,” the CEO adds.\nAs for the future, Gaevoy says he is considering launching a financial derivatives exchange to fill the gap left by FTX. Wintermute had lost $59 million when the Sam Bankman-Fried exchange collapsed, which saw it move its assets on centralized exchanges to Binance, Kraken, and Coinbase.\nIn August 2022, Tron DAO appointed Wintermute as a whitelisted institution of the TRON DAO Reserve; a role that was also given to FTX-linked Alameda Research before its collapse.\nTotal crypto market at $762 billion following FTX collapse | Source: Crypto Total Market Cap on TradingView.com\nFeatured image from CryptoSlate, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-22 16:39:10", "entity": ["bitcoin", "btc"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "In December 2020, for example, when bitcoin was trading around $20,000, he said that the cryptocurrency \"should be worth around $400,000.\" The BTC price climbed to just above $40,000 in January 2021 and peaked around $69,000 late last year."}, {"date": "2022-12-22 16:02:00", "entity": ["polygon", "polygon", "polygonscan", "polygon", "polygon", "matic", "polygon", "ethereum", "zkevm", "zkevm", "ethereum", "polygon", "testnet"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "According to PolygonScan, the number of unique addresses on the Polygon network passed the milestone of 200 million this week, reaching an all-time high of 201,024,643.\nThe rest of Polygon's network indicators remain in a steady upward trend.

The “MVRV ratio” is an indicator that measures the ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin and its realized cap. The realized cap is a capitalization model for BTC that calculates a sort of “real value” for the asset by assuming that the true worth of each coin in circulation is the price at which the particular coin was last moved.\nBy comparing this realized cap with the market cap, the indicator tells us whether the coin’s actual price is fair or not right now. Here is a chart that shows the trend in three moving averages (10-day, 15-day, and 20-day) of this metric over the last few months:\nThe three MAs seem to have been closing in on each other in recent days | Source: CryptoQuant\nThese three MAs of the Bitcoin MVRV Ratio together form the “Triple Ribbon” indicator, and crossovers between these ribbons have historically had implications for the price of the asset. As you can see in the above graph, whenever the 10-day MA has passed below both the 15-day and the 20-day versions, while at the same time the 20-day has gone above both the others (thus keeping the 15-day’s position unchanged in the middle), a bearish crossover has formed for BTC.\nThere have been two instances of such a cross during the last few months; the first one occurred back in August when Bitcoin was at the height of its first relief rally of this bear market, while the other one formed in November right as the FTX crash came around. In both of these occurrences, BTC’s price took a deep plunge following the cross formation.\nFrom the chart, it’s apparent that the MVRV Ratio Triple Ribbon has once again been approaching this same kind of bearish crossover recently. If these MAs continue in this trajectory and the cross does end up happening, then it might mean the crypto will see another sharp drop soon.\nBTC Price\nLooks like the value of the asset has continued to move sideways in the last few days | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price floats around $16,800, down 5% in the last week.\nFeatured image from Mark Basarab on Unsplash.com, charts from TradingView.com, CryptoQuant.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-22 14:30:45", "entity": ["bitcoin", "glassnode", "s19 pro", "s19 xp hyd", "btc", "bitcoin", "btc", "btcus", "unsplash. com", "tradingview. com", "glassnode", "cambridge bitcoin", "glassnode", "glassnode", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "glassnode", "btc", "bitcoin", "glassnode"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Here’s some data from Glassnode that reveals estimates related to the power consumption of the Bitcoin network, if all miners used the same mining machines.\nBitcoin Network Best-Case Scenario Would Be 4.8x More Efficient Than Worst-Case\nAs per the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the power estimates are based on the current hashrate of the BTC network. The “mining hashrate” is an indicator that measures the total amount of computing power connected to the Bitcoin blockchain right now.\nIn the real world, this hashrate is contributed by miners spread across the globe, who all have different situations and environments to deal with that result in different profit margins for each of them. The available capital with each miner can also be quite different, so only the largest companies can afford to upgrade their facilities to the latest and most efficient rigs.\nAll these differences result in a very diverse network, where a large variety of mining rigs would be in use between the miners, and even across the same facility, the machines may be a mix of old and new models. This obviously makes it quite tricky to calculate a true power consumption estimate for Bitcoin, so what Glassnode has done is calculate the power of the network by assuming a uniform blockchain, for four different mining rigs. The below chart displays this data.\nLooks like the worst-case scenario consumes nearly 24 GW in power | Source: Glassnode\nThe four machines used here are S9, S17, S19 Pro, and S19 XP Hyd from the Antminer series. Released in 2017, the S9 is the least efficient machine out of these, so the power consumption figure for the Bitcoin network if the entire hashrate was from S9 alone provides an approximate upper bound of almost 24 Gigawatt (GW). On the other hand, the best-case scenario (the S19 XP Hyd, launched this year) would put the figure at around 5 GW. Naturally, both these bounds are purely theoretical and are highly unlikely to be a representation of the real blockchain.\nThe actual power consumption figure is probably near the 7 GW and 11 GW estimates of the other two machines (S17 and S19 Pro, respectively). In fact, these hashrate-based figures are close to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, which puts the estimated power at around 10 GW.\nWith these estimates for the different mining rigs, Glassnode has also showcased the efficiency gains involved with these machines.

Such a large difference may be the result of a funds distribution or any other operation that would synthetically increase the transaction volume on the network.\nHowever, the answer to the abnormally large whale-tier transactions volume can be found in the percentage of large BCH holders. Almost 70% of the network is owned by whales, which makes almost every transaction on the blockchain related to them.

As part of the investigation, it was revealed that the bank engaged in “widespread mismanagement” of more than 16 million consumer accounts.\nAs CNBC reports, Wells Fargo charged illegal interest rates on auto and mortgage loans and overdraft fees, stole customer funds through other false charges on checking and savings accounts, and unlawfully froze accounts, among other things.\nRipple’s general counsel Alderoty similarly remarked on today’s SEC charges against Alameda’s chief executive Caroline Ellison and FTX co-founder Gary Wang, attacking chair Gary Gensler for only wanting to protect sophisticated investors.\n“When Chair Gensler says that ‘investors were left holding the bag,’ he may want you to believe that he’s talking about FTX’s customers who lost billions. He’s not. He’s referring only to FTX’s sophisticated equity investors. The SEC has lost the plot line,” Alderoty commented on Twitter.\nNot too long ago, Alderoty attacked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for doing the same thing. The last three tweets from Ripple’s legal counsel revolve around this very issue, with Alderoty not tweeting often and always getting an important message across. He also attacked Kevin O’Leary:\nKevin O’Leary and all other venture investors in FTX should immediately demand that the SEC stop spending taxpayer money on its tag along case against SBF since that case only seeks to recover on their behalf.\nUpdated Court Schedule For Ripple Vs. SEC\nMeanwhile, there have once again been small changes in the schedule of the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Both parties most recently filed their motions for summary judgment, including oppositions and responses.\nHowever, there are still disputes over sealings in connection with the motions. At this time, it is unclear whether these disputes will be resolved before or at the time the motions are decided.\nIn addition, the motions to exclude expert testimony (“Daubert” challenges) remain pending. District Judge Torres ruled on their sealing on December 19.\nThe remaining updated schedule calls for both Ripple and the SEC to file their omnibus motions to seal all summary judgment-related materials today, December 22.\nOn January 4, all non-parties must file a motion to seal if both parties to the dispute have not already done so. After that, on January 9, the deadline to oppose the omnibus motions to seal expires.\nA few days later, on January 13, both parties must file the Daubert motions and related exhibits with redactions on the public docket. The current final date set is January 18. On that day, Ripple and the SEC must file any objections to the non-parties motions.\nHow things proceed after that is in the hands of Judge Analisa Torres.

These days, it's possible to play with people from all over the world in massive, multiplayer games. From titles such as League of Legends and DOTA 2 to the increasingly popular battle royale games like Fortnite and Apex Legends – gaming has become an incredibly social experience.\nEnter the concept of gaming guilds. These clans of like-minded players have become a popular way for gamers to socialize and show their skills while forming tight-knit communities, and it looks as though the power of Web3 technology is about to bring a whole new spin to the idea.\nWhat are gaming guilds?\nTo put it simply, a gaming guild (also known as a clan) is an organized group of players that play together in the same game. They often have their own distinct identities and special features, such as logos and colors, that help set them apart from other guilds.\nGuilds are a great way for players to meet new people, learn from each other, and compete against other guilds to prove their skills. They can also offer members rewards for playing together and taking part in events, while also uniting fans of eSports and other gaming-related content.\nYou can find guilds that are dedicated to just one game, such as those you will find on World of Warcraft servers, or larger guilds that operate across multiple games and genres. Here are some popular examples of the latter, all of which operate as professional eSport teams in the Web2 gaming world:\nFnatic – A world-renowned eSports organization focused mainly on Counter-Strike Global Offensive, Dota 2, and League of Legends.\nTeam Liquid – A professional eSports team founded in 2000 and based in the Netherlands, with teams for nearly all major competitive games.\nFaZe Clan – An American eSports organization that specializes in first-person shooter and battle royale titles such as Call of Duty, PUBG, Fortnite, Rainbow Six Siege, and Apex Legends.\nOf course, there are also more casual Web2 guilds that are perfect for people who just want to hang out and have some fun without the pressure of competition.\nThe tokenization of gaming guilds\nWeb3 has opened up a world of possibilities across just about every industry, and gaming is no exception. As such, for the guilds that want to take things up a notch, tokenization offers some exciting opportunities.\nBy using blockchain technology, guild owners are able to create and manage their own digital tokens, which they can use to reward members for activities such as playing together, competing in tournaments, or even creating content. These tokens can also be used to buy and sell virtual assets, such as skins or in-game items, giving guilds a chance to generate their own revenue streams and create a secondary marketplace for their members.\nThis is an exciting proposition for gamers, as it gives them the chance to own a piece of something bigger than themselves and potentially generate some income from their favorite games. For guild owners, it can also be a great way to incentivize and reward their members, while also providing them with more control over how their guild operates.\nHow tokenized gaming guilds will function\nAt a basic level, tokenized gaming guilds will work in much the same way as traditional guilds. Members will join the guild and have access to certain privileges and benefits, such as being able to chat in the guild’s dedicated channels, access exclusive tournaments and events, receive rewards for playing together, and even earn digital tokens for their activities.\nHowever, the key difference is that these tokens will be stored on a blockchain and will be transferable to other players or even outside exchanges. This means that members can use the tokens to buy and sell virtual assets, as well as earn rewards for their participation in the guild.\nWhile this is still a relatively new concept, there are already some exciting projects that are exploring how tokenized gaming guilds could function. For example, Legendary: Heroes Unchained (LHU) is a brand new, play-to-own RPG game built from the ground up for blockchain by N3twork Studios.\nWithin LHU, which is set in the same world as the blockbuster mobile hit Legendary: Game of Heroes, players can join or create their own gaming guilds and earn digital tokens through events, tournaments, and other activities. With the help of blockchain technology, LHU's in-game items are stored as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) on the Ethereum network, meaning that players can buy and sell their loot for real money. This raises the stakes for guilds and clans, as the game’s digital economy adds a whole new level of competition.\nInterestingly, Fnatic also looks like it has its eyes set on establishing a presence in the Web3 space. The eSports team recently partnered with Hivemind Capital, a Web3 investment firm, in order to ‘accelerate Fnatic’s ability to partner as well as natively develop and scale web3 applications across its award-winning esports platform.’\nSpeaking about the partnership, the CEO and Founder of Fnatic, Sam Matthews, had this to say:\n“The partnership with Hivemind represents a big step for us towards a world where every gamer owns their digital assets and most games have an app-store-like developer-user ecosystem that’s transparent, thriving and enables millions more gamers to make a living from gaming.”\nFinal word\nWith the introduction of Web3 to the gaming world, it will be interesting to see how tokenized gaming guilds develop. With the potential to earn rewards and compete in tournaments, as well as buy and sell virtual items, these new types of guilds could introduce a whole new level of social interaction and competition to the gaming landscape.\nOnly time will tell whether these guilds will become popular and stay around for the long haul, but there’s no denying that they could be a game-changer for the industry.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The only period in which Lido has been showing above average performance was the pre-Merge market era, when the DAO was one of the most popular ways of gaining liquidity with the staked Ethereum.\nAfter the launch of Ethereum staking, Lido Finance faced a significant amount of pressure as investors raised questions about the business model utilized by the project.

But if this phrase is misplaced, users risk losing all of their crypto assets. Worse, your written seed phrase could be captured on camera for the world to see.\nHardware wallet startup Cypherock believes it has the solution to this potentially fraught scenario, and has raised seed funding to build it.\nAD\nAD\nCypherock exclusively told Decrypt this week that it has raised $1 million in a seed round with investments from ConsenSys Mesh, Infinite Capital, Gnosis and its co-founder Stefan George, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal, Mahin Gupta, OrangeDAO, and others.\nRohan Agarwal, co-founder and CEO of Cypherock, told Decrypt that the current approach to securing crypto wallets creates multiple opportunities for potential mishaps.\n\"You have to keep your wallet secure because they have been hacked before,\" he said. \"And you have to keep your seed phrase secure, as well. So you now have two single points of failure that you have to keep secure.\"\nThis video of cops in Nevada searching a suspect and finding a seed phrase is pretty wild. Imagine having your seed phrase become part of public record due to it being captured by an officer's body camera! pic.twitter.com/vS2vm0xh7N — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 18, 2022\nThe company’s Cypherock X1 hardware wallet, which launched in October 2022, uses four encrypted near-field communication (NFC) cards to store users' private keys and what would be the seed phrase. Tapping any of the cards to the wallet approves a transaction, and Cypherock advises that users store each in a different geographic location.\n\"These cards use the same secure hardware used in the banking industry for making debit cards and credit cards,\" Agarwal told Decrypt. \"So using the same secure hardware, but our own software that is written inside these cards, we take that secure infrastructure and port it to Web3.\"\nHardware wallets, also known as cold storage, are considered the best option for securing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. A hardware wallet keeps users’ private keys in a secure offline environment, safe from potential online attacks and intrusions.\nAgarwal said that the Cypherock X1 can only be upgraded to support new cryptocurrencies, but the cards themselves can’t be upgraded or changed once shipped to users. The company took this stance to protect users from malicious attacks, and provide peace of mind that even a potential bad actor within Cypherock’s company couldn’t mess with their wallet.\nAD\nAD\n\"What that means is, even if there's a malicious software developer inside [Cypherock], they will only be able to compromise the device,\" he said. \"They will never be able to compromise the cards.\"\nRethinking wallets\nWhy should crypto investors consider Cypherock’s hardware wallet? Agarwal points to the frequent scams targeting crypto users, primarily phishing scams that ask users to connect their wallets to a malicious website or give their private key or seed phrase to scammers.\n\"During the bull market, there were so many people who lost funds because they didn't have that [technical knowledge] around managing a seed phrase, and they gave the phrase to random strangers on the internet trying to phish the users,\" Agarwal said.\nBut self-custody wallets can be tricky to use and secure. Just recently, Binance CEO and founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao said that “99% of people” will lose crypto assets by mishandling a wallet. There’s also risk with writing down seed phrases, as seen in the police bodycam video example.\nCypherock’s unique system is not meant to lock users into its model, Agarwal explained, adding that its technology is open source and funds can be moved from their wallet whenever the users want. Users can view the seed phrase by tapping an NFC card and entering a PIN number, enabling access to transfer funds to another wallet if desired.\nAnd if the Cypherock X1 wallet is lost, users can restore their crypto assets by tapping two of the four NFC cards on the new wallet. Customers can buy new cards from the company and restore assets with the remaining cards if any are lost.\n\"You should have one card and one device in the home and the rest of the three cards away from the home,\" Agarwal said. \"So that, God forbid, [if] your house burns down, your funds are still recoverable from the remaining two or three cards that you might have given to someone else, or stored in a bank locker.\"\nCypherock’s seed funding will go towards product development and marketing, as well as adding more tokens and supporting NFTs. The firm also plans to further develop its multi-party computation (MPC) efforts. Multi-party computation is a subcategory of cryptography designed to create ways for users to share data while keeping the data private.\nThe company’s future plans include facilitating crypto inheritance, in which it helps whomever the user designates to receive their digital assets in the event of their death. Similar projects on the market include Sarcophagus, which offers a crypto \"deadman\" switch that transfers cryptocurrency if specific criteria are not met.\nAD\nAD\nAgarwal told Decrypt that Cypherock is also working on an iOS and Android app that can be used in place of the hardware wallet. And because the firm’s technology is all open source, another developer could make an app that uses the cards—something that Agarwal said is necessary in case the company ever goes out of business.\n\"We are decentralization maximalists,\" Agarwal said. \"We want to decentralize as much as possible on every spectrum and every layer.\""}, {"date": "2022-12-21 19:44:40", "entity": ["fed", "fed", "s & p 500"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "“The probability of a recession is high,” crypto trader Thomas Kralow previously said in an emailed comment. “People lose their jobs, the Fed pivots too late and we will see the same situation that played out back in 2008.

The rewards are based on the amount of storage shared. Thus, users who have plenty of free space on their hard drives and a fast internet connection can reap the most benefits from the new incentives program.\nRewards are paid out in the form of BZZ tokens. The amount of tokens received is determined by the price of renting storage, which is fixed now, but will be calculated in a few weeks by a decentralised oracle according to supply and demand forces.\nStaking has also been introduced to enable participation in the redistribution mechanism, which resembles Ethereum's proof of stake system, choosing storage providers for rewards distribution depending on their staking proportions\nSet up a Node and Start Earning\nTo become a node operator, a standard computer with 20 GB of storage and a stable internet connection is required. The Swarm network is already operational and the team expects the incentives mechanism to help the Swarm economy expand, with the network becoming fully self-sustaining while enforcing a healthy balance between storage operators and users.\nSwarm is also working on a new type of computer, called a Web3PC, which is private by design and respectful of users' rights to use and produce content. The team plans to have a working Web3PC prototype available by June 2023.\nThis computer will communicate, store, and provide services without leaking any private information, and all data will belong to its rightful owners. Fairdrive, a Dropbox-like solution for file storage in Swarm, is already available and allows users to easily use the Swarm network in a familiar Web 2.0 fashion.\nSwarm is on a transformative journey, contributing to the development of the web3 space by letting people regain sovereignty over their own data. In turn, this will allow for the freeflow of information without censorship or data tracking. Users will be able to keep their data private or, in turn, get paid for sharing it with marketers and companies of their choosing.\nAbout Swarm\nSwarm is a decentralised data storage and distribution technology. It's a base layer infrastructure for Web3 on which developers can create, host, and store dApps and all their accompanying data, NFT meta-data, and media files. It's an open-source, p2p network that respects the privacy of its users' data and secures it by default.\nThe Swarm protocol shares similarities with P2P (peer-to-peer) storage networks like BitTorrent but the main difference with other decentralized storage solutions stands out with its integrated economic incentives, which enable permissionless upload and censorship-resistant data architecture.\nA structural difference is the data upload solution. With other popular storage solutions, that contract is made directly with the storer, knowing the data stored, making them suitable for private data only. In Swarm, due to its architecture, such a deal is made with the whole network, delivering the permissionless property and making it suitable for both private and public data.\nSwarm aims to serve as the serverless internet operating system for hosting and running dApps (decentralised applications).\nLearn more by visiting www.ethswarm.org\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The data includes on-chain secondary sales, and for new projects released in 2022, also the funds generated by the initial NFT mint.\nNote that CryptoSlam filters out sales that are suspected to be the product of wash trading, or trades done at artificially inflated prices between a user's own wallets. It's often done to manipulate a token rewards model, heavily skewing data in the process. The filtered data provides a better sense of organic trading action.\n(Data accurate as of December 20, 2022)\n10. Axie Infinity - $291.1 million\nLast year’s largest NFT project by far barely made the Top 10 this time around, as monster-battling game Axie Infinity limped into 2022 as its play-to-earn economy struggled. Axie racked up billions of dollars’ worth of trading in 2021 as its token rewards convinced millions of players to buy NFTs and jump in, but momentum fell off a cliff in 2022.\nDespite launching a new version of the game and making tweaks to turn the economy around, Axie Infinity’s trading action has largely petered out across the year. CryptoSlam reported over $126 million in NFT trades in January, but less than $1.5 million in November. The entire NFT market is suffering, but Axie’s decline has been sharper than most.\n9. Sorare - $318.1 million\nEven as NFT prices fell, Web3 fantasy soccer game Sorare continued plugging along with relatively steady sales throughout 2021, ultimately tallying about $318 million worth of trading volume so far this year. NBA Top Shot might have led the sports NFT charge into the mainstream in 2021, but it fell off in 2022 while Sorare continued its solid performance.\nThe $318 million in sales only includes trades via Sorare’s original soccer platform. It launched league-specific NBA and MLB platforms this year, as well, and CryptoSlam displays all of that data under one unified listing on the website. However, a breakdown of the data shows that Sorare’s MLB platform hasn’t gained much traction, while the NBA game only recently launched.\n8. Doodles - $391.6 million\nLaunched last fall, Ethereum profile picture (PFP) project Doodles has major ambitions for its brand, including music and entertainment plays in collaboration with Pharrell Williams, as well as a larger-scale Doodles 2 drop built for the metaverse. And amid those announcements, secondary sales for the original collection kept chugging along in 2022.\nAD\nAD\nDoodles has racked up over $391 million worth of secondary trading volume this year, peaking in January with $122 million. With $54 million in VC funding in its war chest and big plans ahead, we’ll see whether Doodles can maintain momentum in 2023 following steady recent declines in both prices and trading volume.\n7. CryptoPunks - $575.2 million\nThe influential 2017 profile picture project had a relatively eventful 2022. One CryptoPunk was sold for a record-breaking $23.7 million worth of ETH in February, and then creator Larva Labs sold the IP rights to Bored Ape Yacht Club maker Yuga Labs in March.\nYuga has since worked to address some of the complaints from holders, including offering them IP commercialization rights to turn their Punks into derivative artwork and projects, plus working to establish the art world cred of the O.G. NFT collection. Trading wasn’t as fervent as with the Apes this year, but remember: Punks were free to mint at launch. Five years later, they still topped half a billion dollars worth of annual trading.\n6. CloneX - $600.5 million\nThe vibrant, anime-inspired collaboration between the Nike-owned Web3 studio RTFKT and popular artist Takashi Murakami continued to thrive this year following its late 2021 launch, delivering just over $600 million worth of trading volume so far.\nBeyond the boldly stylized avatars, part of the value equation has been RTFKT’s continued push to deliver benefits to holders, including airdropped NFTs that gave them Nike’s CryptoKicks digital wearables. Like most projects on this list, prices and demand have fallen in recent months—but RTFKT keeps teasing big plans for its future and its NFT holders.\n5. Moonbirds - $613.4 million\nKevin Rose’s Proof startup made a huge splash in April with the launch of Moonbirds, a collection of 10,000 pixel owl avatars that quickly generated $280 million worth of minting and trading within just two days of launch. The feverish momentum eventually subsided, but even so, the project has topped $613 million in total activity so far this year.\nMoonbirds followed the late 2021 launch of the buzzy Proof Collective membership NFT, which itself surged in value amid the Moonbirds frenzy. Proof has since raised a bunch of cash and made big plans for next year, although its move to open-source its artwork earned pushback from holders. Will Moonbirds sales keep flying in 2023?\n4. Azuki - $849.9 million\nHere it is: the highest-ranking new project of 2022 that wasn’t spun off from an existing IP. Azuki rolled out in January and thrived for months until the NFT market crashed in May, ultimately racking up about $850 million worth of trading to date.\nThe anime-inspired project has also done a better job than most of maintaining value, as measured in ETH, while its Beanz “sidekick” NFTs—airdropped free to holders—have racked up another $233 million worth of trading volume on their own. Azuki’s recent push to pair physical products with NFTs has also given it a unique hook going forward.\n3. Otherside - $1.1 billion\nThe Bored Ape Yacht Club’s metaverse play is easily the largest new NFT launch of 2022, with the initial mint and secondary sales collectively generating some $561 million worth within 24 hours. The huge resale barrage then pushed OpenSea to its best single day of trading volume to date… right before the wider crypto market collapsed. Now the tally between mint and secondary sales tops the billion-dollar mark.\nAD\nAD\nWith Otherside, what NFT traders are buying is an Otherdeed, or a plot of land within the forthcoming metaverse game’s world. Yuga held a first interactive test for the game a few months back and plans additional demo experiences as development continues, though it could be quite some time before those Otherdeeds are functional.\n2. Mutant Ape Yacht Club - $1.14 billion\nThe Mutant Apes—the wilder-looking, cheaper counterparts to Bored Apes—grabbed the second spot on the 2022 ranking. There are twice as many Mutant Apes and they trade more frequently than the original Bored Apes, so the collection managed to top $1.1 billion worth of sales this year despite the much lower average prices for this set.\nMutant Ape Yacht Club NFT owners got an allocation of the ApeCoin drop in March, and were also able to claim a free Otherdeed in April, so ownership definitely had benefits in 2022 even if they’re not considered to be as prestigious as the Bored Apes.\n1. Bored Ape Yacht Club - $1.57 billion\nEven before running the math, there was little doubt over which project would top this list. Bored Ape Yacht Club racked up more than $1.5 billion worth of trades as hype sustained the collection through much of 2022.\nNo doubt, the buzz around the ApeCoin and Otherside launches helped propel trades and rising prices for the Bored Apes. But so did their rising awareness and cachet across both crypto and mainstream culture, with Apes snagged by celebrities and used to launch brands and products. Prices have fallen sharply since the April peak, but Bored Apes still ruled the year in NFTs."}, {"date": "2022-12-21 17:00:46", "entity": ["microstrategy", "bitcoin", "microstrategy", "microstrategy", "bitcoin", "microstrategy", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "microstrategy", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "##currency bitcoin", "btc", "digital gold", "bitcoin", "microstrategy", "btc", "@ microstrategy", "mstr", "bitcoin", "schiff", "btc", "btcus", "tradingview. com", "btc", "microstrategy", "bitcoin", "saylor", "btc", "bitcoin", "microstrategy", "btc", "btc", "tradingview. com"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Bitcoin detractor and economist Peter Schiff has taken another swipe at the digital asset and MicroStrategy, a public company that is heavily invested in the digital asset. Schiff has always been vocal about his disdain for bitcoin and has now turned his attention to MicroStrategy and its former CEO, Michael Saylor.\nWhy MicroStrategy Bought Bitcoin\nIn a tweet, Peter Schiff revealed to his more than 890,000 Twitter followers what he says was the real reason behind Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy’s move to begin investing in bitcoin. According to Schiff, former CEO Michael Saylor had admitted that buying BTC was actually a last-ditch effort to save the company from being liquidated. He further dissed the company saying that it has nothing going for it other than a leveraged speculative position on the digital asset.\nFor the first time I heard @saylor admit that adding #Bitcoin to the @MicroStrategy balance sheet was basically a Hail Mary to avoid liquidating the company. If the only thing $MSTR has going for it is a leveraged speculative position in Bitcoin, than it has nothing going for it. — Peter Schiff (@PeterSchiff) December 20, 2022\nAs expected, Schiff’s strikes toward bitcoin were met with pushback from supporters. One user took to the comment section to defend MicroStrategy’s decision as one that was taken so it could acquire the “scarcest and most desirable asset the world has ever seen.” However, Schiff would denounce this saying that bitcoin was in no way scarce nor was it desirable. He also added that bitcoin was a way to lose money.\nSchiff continues to advocate for gold as a better option for investors.

You don’t need to buy [Gold].”\nBTC touches above $16,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\nSo Why Did Saylor Buy BTC?\nMichael Saylor is arguably one of the most vocal bitcoin bulls. The ex-CEO of MicroStrategy has previously stated that his decision to purchase bitcoin was that he believed that the digital asset is the future of finance. Additionally, Saylor previously revealed that he had personally owned BTC before MicroStrategy had begun purchasing the cryptocurrency, his own personal holdings serving as evidence for the profitability of the asset.\nAs the company expects the price of bitcoin to appreciate over time, it believes that it will serve as an effective inflation hedge over the long term. Saylor himself has referred to BTC as “digital gold, saying “We find the global acceptance, brand recognition, ecosystem vitality, network dominance, architectural resilience, technical utility, and community ethos of Bitcoin to be persuasive evidence of its superiority as an asset class for those seeking a long-term store of value.”\nMicroStrategy’s decision to invest in bitcoin also helped boost the popularity of the company, going from a company operating in the background to one of the most popular names among cryptocurrency enthusiasts.\nMicroStrategy is currently the public company with the largest BTC holdings in the world. The company held 130,000 BTC as of Sep. 30, 2022, worth over $2.1 billion at current market prices. At a cumulative entry value of almost $4 billion, the company is recording more than $1.7 billion in unrealized losses following the market downturn.\nFeatured image from Blockchain Reporter, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-21 17:00:02", "entity": ["warner bros.", "hbo", "discovery", "dc", "cartoon network", "hgtv", "eurosport", "wbdgcp", "niftys", "westero", "nifty ’ s", "warner bros", "discovery global consumer products", "nift nifty", "nifty", "nifty", "nifty", "warner bros", "discovery", "warner bros", "discovery global consumer products", "wbdgcp", "warner bros. discovery", "wbdgcp", "iconic moments"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Miami, United States, 21st December, 2022, Chainwire\nThe highly anticipated digital collectible experience is coming on January 10, 2023, with additional releases to follow.\nEarlier this fall, Nifty’s, the platform for NFT-powered fan communities, and Warner Bros.

With less than two weeks left in the year 2022, companies have begun looking to the new year and tailoring their expectations for the year. For crypto companies such as Coinbase, it includes development on important which they are watching and how they expect these networks to perform in the New Year.\nWhere Is Cardano?\nThe report released by Coinbase takes a look at the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum, the developments, as well as topics such as regulation and NFTs, among others. However, in a tweet, Charles Hoskinson notes that the report does not mention the Cardano network.\nThe tweet which included a screenshot of the first page of the 57-page report said: “Not a single mention of Cardano. Pretty low and pretty sad. I honestly expected better.”\nNot a single mention of Cardano. Pretty low and pretty sad. I honestly expected better pic.twitter.com/0VHSdm5A2H — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) December 21, 2022\nThis has now sparked speculations that the crypto exchange had intentionally left out Cardano, especially when it mentions other Layer 1s such as Avalanche, Fanton and Solana, all of which Cardano ranks above in terms of market cap.\nA reply under the founder’s tweet also pointed out that the Cardano news and community updates section on the Coinbase app were all out of date, with the last post highlighted to be from Oct. 4.\nI was recently curious why NEWS and COMMUNITY UPDATES on Coinbase, under Cardano are out of date. Is that Coinbase job to keep it updated? How come Solana has recent news? https://t.co/3rygDHi6rb — MCJ (@matthewjura) December 21, 2022\nSo What Does The Report Talk About?\nCoinbase’s report mainly revolved around the current crypto market landscape. Although it does not mention Cardano, it focuses heavily on Layer 1s and Layer 2s which it says was becoming much more competitive with time.\nThe report explains that a lot of the activity on these blockchains was swaying outside of the established cyclical market trend. Instead, each blockchain sees differences in usage and transaction growth not in tandem with one another.\n“There is healthy user demand for solutions that address issues of scalability, speed, and/or transaction fees, but what is less obvious is whether this will become a winner-take-all market,” the report says.\nADA price trending above $0.25 | Source: ADAUSD on TradingView.com\nIt also mentions the FTX collapse and how the event has affected the liquidity in the market. Likewise, it has also had an impact on how legislation around the market is being viewed, as well as the diminished trust in the market following the crypto exchange’s implosion. But Coinbase expects the aftermath to provide a ripe environment for new innovation to push the industry towards more sustainable growth and less speculation.\nFeatured image from Coinbase, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-21 17:00:00", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "\"Lamina1 is in a unique position given the incredible volume of inquiries we receive from those building the open metaverse every day,” said Vessenes. \"The team has a front-row seat to all happening in the ecosystem and essentially gets a ‘first look’ at what many of the most compelling creators and storytellers of our time are doing, building, making, and producing around the world.\""}, {"date": "2022-12-21 16:56:01", "entity": ["youtube"], "sentiment": ["Negative"], "content": "The two men's legal battle emanated from a 2019 discussion – subsequently broadcast on YouTube – in which McCormack called Wright a liar and a fraud and said he \"is not Satoshi.\" Wright claimed that such comments caused him financial damage after he was disinvited to speak at various events and conferences."}, {"date": "2022-12-21 16:10:56", "entity": ["nfts"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "In a submission to the authority, the exchange pointed out that the ad was no longer live and that it promoted the trading platform, not a specific NFT.

As I noted earlier, it results in the party on one side of the trade taking custody of what was the multisig wallet of their counterparty on the other side of the trade. What I’ve called “Liquifinity” is an atomic-swap technology that cryptographically secures against either party walking away before they give their counterparty the keys for the multisig to be transferred and thereby complete the swap. So parties that placed a bid for a price above the clearing price consummate a trade with randomly-selected counterparties that committed to an ask below the clearing price.

Significantly, these different configurations can redistribute the costs of participating between traders (slippages, as described above) and capital providers (the much rehearsed impermanent loss).

During this time, investors have felt the catastrophic effects of the collapse of FTX.\nFTX was one of the largest exchanges in the crypto market. Its sudden collapse left investors with losses of millions of dollars. One of the groups that were hit hardest by FTX’s collapse were Solana (SOL) investors.\nHowever, amidst the chaos, two coins served as strong hedges against such market volatility: Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) and Cardano (ADA). Most notably, the Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) presale has seen predictions of a 6000% price increase by the end of January.\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\nSolana (SOL)\nSolana (SOL) is a high-performance blockchain platform with up to 50,000 transactions per second.\nSolana’s ambition is to create an open-source project that can scale to billions of users and remain secure, decentralized, and trustless. Solana is intended to provide an alternative blockchain platform for developers and entrepreneurs looking for a reliable, high-performance blockchain platform.\nHowever, Solana's performance was hit hard in the past year due to a changing macroeconomic environment. As investors move away from risky assets, Solana’s token SOL has seen a significant decrease in its value.\nIt was also one of the cryptocurrencies that was hit hardest by the collapse of FTX, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. Solana had a major exposure to FTX, which was also one of its biggest investors. This caused the crypto to drop significantly after the collapse of the FTX. Many traders question if Solana would ever recover from the collapse.\nCardano (ADA)\nCardano (ADA) is an open-source, distributed public blockchain and cryptocurrency project founded in 2017 by Charles Hoskinson. Cardano seeks to provide a more balanced and secure approach toward smart contract development and is built on the founders' ideas of combining innovation with scientific philosophy.\nCardano's consensus mechanism allows for increased scalability while maintaining high levels of security. This is thanks to Cardano’s unique Ouroboros Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm, which was created with the latest cryptographic and distributed systems research.\nCardano also aims to differentiate itself from other blockchain platforms by providing advanced features such as side chains, multi-asset support, and smart contracts.\nSince the FTX collapse, Cardano has proven itself to be a strong hedge against market volatility. Due to its low exposure to FTX, Cardano has not seen the same drastic losses as other cryptocurrencies.\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN)\nOrbeon Protocol (ORBN) is a decentralized investment platform for venture capital and crowdfunding. This innovative project aims to democratize early-stage startup investment.\nSo far, startup investing has been mostly reserved for professional investors and venture capitalists. However, Orbeon Protocol is built to enable anyone to easily invest in early-stage startups. This platform uses fractional NFTs (fNFTs) to enable investors to invest in startups with as little as $1. These NFTs are backed by equity, allowing everyday investors to access the venture capital industry while startups can raise capital much faster than before.\nOrbeon Protocol also has blockchain-enabled security features for a more secure and transparent investment process. One of these features is the “Fill or Kill” mechanism that full returns investor funds in the event of a failed funding round.\nSince the launch of its presale, the project’s native ORBN token has seen a 655% surge in token price, largely owing this to the benefits ORBN grants holders. These range from governance rights to exclusive investor community access. With this upward trend, experts believe ORBN could surge as much as 6000% in the coming weeks.\nFind Out More About The Orbeon Protocol Presale\nWebsite: https://orbeonprotocol.com/\nPresale: https://presale.orbeonprotocol.com/register\nTelegram: https://t.me/OrbeonProtocol\nDisclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

It has also dropped more than 60% from its price of $46,320 on New Year’s Day.\nThe second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum (ETH), which began the year at $3,686, trades at $1,215 as of December 21.\nCredit has to be given where it's due, and the two market leaders were not the sturdiest crypto assets this year. Decrypt consulted data from across the industry to round up this year’s best-performing coins, DeFi tokens, and equities for your reading pleasure (or pain).\nGiven the wild unknowns of the market, this list certainly does not constitute investment advice, but it does throw light on not only some of the biggest stories of the year but also perhaps some of the more surprising.\nDeFi token: Lido Staked ETH (stETH) Image: Shutterstock.\nHow much\nFor the second year running, Lido Staked ETH has held the throne as our top DeFi token of the year on a per market capitalization basis. It’s also proven the most robust. It began the year with a market capitalization of $5,985,253,189 and now heads into Christmas at $5,793,073,401, meaning its corner of the market has only contracted by about 3%.\nWhat is it\nLido is a staking protocol that allows people to stake any amount of ETH through smart contracts–automated self-executing financial contracts. Users earn yield in stETH a token pegged to ETH that can be redeemed 1:1 for Ethereum. The token can also be lent, staked and traded for other tokens throughout DeFi.\nIt’s not just ETH either; users can also stake Solana, Polygon, Polkadot, and Kusama.\nAD\nAD\nLido was at the center of controversy this year after crypto lender Celsius froze withdrawals to stop a bank run that could have further depleted the price of stETH, after it slipped its peg by 6% back in June. It came to light that Celsius had staked customer funds on Lido. Similarly, bankrupt crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital (3AC) cited Lido as one of three trades that ultimately blew up the company.\nDespite these controversies, stETH's performance has also been helped along this year in part due to users rushing to stake their ETH ahead of this year's merge event, which jettisoned Ethereum from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism.\nOf the total 15.7 million in ETH deposited across all staking platforms, including Coinbase and Binance, roughly 30% of those tokens have been staked on Lido and converted to stETH.\nRead more:\nHow Ethereum Stakers on Lido Finance Are Trading the Merge\nLido Token Jumps 24% as Staked Ethereum Slowly Repegs\nRunners up:\nDai (DAI) down 42% ($8,945,308,696 to $5,178,770,761)\nUniswap (UNI) down 48% ($7,753,293,079 to $3,987,950,916)\nCoin: Trust Wallet (TWT) Image: Shutterstock.\nHow much\nWhile various outlier cryptocurrencies made greater gains this year, for this category and the next, we stuck with cryptocurrencies that are in the top 100 by market cap. Given the flash-in-the-pan nature of many tokens, a high market cap is a good indicator of how many people have believed in the project enough to open their wallets for it.\nAD\nAD\nTrust Wallet climbed 116% from $0.71 on New Year’s Day to a current price of around $1.54 as of December 21.\nWhat is it\nTrust Wallet is a governance token used to vote on new developments for the Binance-owned self-custody wallet. After the collapse of various centralized crypto lenders and exchanges this year, consumer and industry conversations turned firmly towards security, in particular towards self-custody solutions, like decentralized exchanges and self-custody wallets, which also include hardware wallets.\nBinance acquired Trust Wallet back in 2018; its CEO, Changpeng Zhao, later shilled the project and helped pump the price of the wallet’s native token after FTX’s collapse.\nRead more:\nTrust Wallet Token Soars 47% as Binance CEO Shills Self-Custody Solution\nRunners up:\nGMX (GMX) up 103%, LEO Token (LEO) up 6.5%\nMemecoin: Dogecoin (DOGE) Image: Shutterstock.\nHow much\nDogecoin didn’t fall off quite as steeply as its nearest rivals. This year’s top memecoin depreciated by about 58%, from $0.17 at the start of the year to around $0.07 as of December 20.\nWhat is it\nDogecoin was created by software programmers Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus in 2013, who intended the project to be a tongue-in-cheek satire of the then-emergent craze of minting altcoins that have little value beyond mere novelty symbolism. The cryptocurrency picked up a rabid fanbase when Bitcoin began its bull run at the end of 2020. They’re known colloquially as the “Doge Army.”\nThe coin’s avatar is the iconic chubby Shiba Inu dog, whose face rose to prominence as a meme accompanied by adorable phrases in broken English, like “Much wow” and “Very impress.” It has since spawned waves of copycat coins, like the top 100 cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB) and has as its most famous fan and “Dogefather,” the Tesla, SpaceX and Twitter CEO Elon Musk, whose Doge-shilling tweets often pump the price.\nAD\nAD\nRead more:\nElon Musk and Crypto: No One Man Should Have All That Power\nRunners up:\nShiba Inu (SHIB), down 75%, ($0.00003345 to $0.00000825)\nDogelon Mars (ELON), down 81% ($$0.00000156 to 0.000000296875)\nPublicly traded crypto company: Block (SQ) Image: Shutterstock.\nHow much\nSQ stock has decreased 56%, down from $141.54 at the start of January to $61.41 per share as of December 20.\nWhat is it\nBlock, Inc, formerly known as Square, is a crypto-friendly payments company run by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Dorsey is an avid Bitcoin bull and, through the company, has spent hundreds of millions on Bitcoin so far. He has also avidly defended Bitcoin against criticism of the environmental impact of the network’s mining operations. Understandably, crypto companies fared little better than cryptocurrencies this year, with most of them in the red since the start of January.\nRead more:\nJack Dorsey's Block Reports $36M Impairment Loss on Bitcoin Holdings\nBlock's Bitcoin Revenue From Cash App Hit Nearly $2 Billion in Q4\nAD\nAD\nRunners up:\nCoinbase (COIN) fell 85% (from $232.33 to $35.12)\nMicroStrategy (MSTR) fell 64.5% (from 482.95 to 171.52)\nPublicly traded crypto-curious company: Visa (V) Image: Shutterstock\nHow much\nVisa’s stock price began the year at $216.96, and it only depreciated 4.9% to hit $206.28 as of December 21.\nWhat is it\nVisa is no stranger to the world of finance, leading the payments industry with Mastercard. Besides previous occasions to rope in crypto projects, this year was a particularly active one in terms of the firm turning to decentralized money. In October, for example, the payments giant filed several trademark applications which hinted at a cryptocurrency wallet, launching non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and much more.\nOn December 19, Visa announced its sustained interest in the industry despite getting burned by the collapse of FTX. “We want to have an opportunity to actively contribute to technical developments happening in the crypto ecosystem,” Catherine Gu, Visa’s Head of CBDC and Protocols, told Decrypt. “The best way to do that is learning by doing—actually getting deeper into Web3 infrastructures and blockchain protocols, areas I think are going to be really important for payments.”\nRead more:\nVisa, PayPal, Western Union Among Fall Flurry of Crypto Trademark Filings\nVisa Pulls Plug on FTX Partnership, Will Wind Down Debit Cards: Report\nRunners up:\nAD\nAD\nWestern Union Company (WU) fell 28% (from $19.01 to $13.68)\nPublicly Traded Crypto Miner: Canaan Inc (CAN) Image: Shutterstock.\nHow much:\nCanaan Inc (CAN) stocks fell from $4.67 when markets opened this year on January 3 to $2.14 as of December 21, a depreciation of 54% in what has been a very tough year for mining companies.\nWhat is it\nChina-based Canaan Inc. was one of the first movers in crypto. Founded in 2013, Canaan manufactures high-performance chips and other hardware for crypto mining rigs. It’s a popular company—its products are sold to over 150 countries—and it also recently launched a new line of mining rigs called the Avalon Made A13 (“A13”) Series.

With Orbeon Protocol (ORBN), startups get direct access to the capital they need to scale their projects without having to put in months of legwork.\nEquity-based NFTs replace the stocks that come with traditional investing, allowing investors to own a part of their favorite startups with the same ease as the rest of the crypto community. Plus, fractionalization means that investors can purchase with as little as $1, greatly expanding the potential pool of investors.\nSmart contracts bypass the need for middlemen and manual verification, allowing transactions to move at lightning speed. Plus, the rigorous security protocols in place on the platform ensure that all users’ funds are safe and secure.\nThe ORBN token is beneficial to hold as it provides rewards like early-bird access to new listings, platform voting rights and staking rewards.\nWith an approach that benefits all parties, a utility token that offers great value, and features that make the investing process easier than ever before, Orbeon Protocol (ORBN) is set to see a 6000% price increase, according to analysts.\n>>BUY ORBEON TOKENS HERE<<\nImmutableX (IMX)\nThe NFT space is associated with high fees and slow transaction times, making it inaccessible to many users. Enter ImmutableX (IMX), the layer-2 scaling solution that solves these problems and makes NFTs more accessible than ever before. As such, ImmutableX has seen significant attention from NFT enthusiasts.\nImmutableX (IMX) achieves this through the use of zk-rollups, a type of layer-2 scaling that allows transactions to take place off-chain while still being securely verified on the Ethereum blockchain.\nWhile there are other Layer-2 options available, ImmutableX (IMX) is already leading the pack in terms of transaction speed and fees. ImmutableX (IMX) has even managed to attract GameStop (GME), the world’s largest video game retailer, as one of its customers. Investors are confident ImmutableX has the potential to see a much further increase in popularity, with some suggesting ImmutableX will be a market leader by 2023.\nQuant (QNT)\nQuant (QNT) is like a bridge between different blockchains, facilitating the secure and efficient transfer of data between them. Quant’s Overledger consensus algorithm acts like the sturdy foundation of the bridge, allowing multiple blockchains to interact with each other without any issues. This means that Quant (QNT) provides an interoperability solution for blockchains in a way that has never been done before.\nQuant (QNT) opens the door to a wide range of applications, including the transfer of digital assets between different blockchains or the sharing of data across multiple networks.

In this post, Kusama explained that he is not responsible for every detail of the Shib project and that he feels sorry for any confusion. Back on Sunday, Dec. 18, U.Today reported a great deal of speculation that the lead developer’s tweet inspired among SHIB community members: some thought that it hints at a major announcement, such as Shibarium. However, it turned out that the announcement was nothing more than an upgrade to the official website.\nRipple ally raises objection to $22 million SEC fine: details\nDefense lawyer James K. Filan has recently taken to Twitter to share updates on the LBRY case : according to his post, the SEC has filed its opposition to LBRY's motion to limit the SEC's remedies. On Nov. 29, the parties met to discuss the terms but were unable to resolve the terms of the remedies sought by the regulator. Then LBRY requested an expedited briefing schedule to limit the SEC remedies, which were approved by the court. The regulator claims that LBRY should pay a penalty equal to its full pecuniary gain: $22,151,971. The lawsuit watchers are now anticipating LBRY's reply to the SEC motion to come soon.\nShiba Inu (SHIB) needs 2% to reach existentially important goal, here's what it is\nEven though Shiba Inu continues massively losing its value, the situation might soon change, as the market participants spotted one important detail. If we look at the criteria called “holders’ composition by time held,” we see that the percentage of long-term Shiba Inu holders has reached 58%. Thus, the meme coin lacks only 2% to surpass the important threshold of 60%, which will make the majority of holders on the network long-term investors. With a growing number of investors who are holding assets for more than a month, Shiba Inu's price performance should stabilize.\nRipple CTO reacts to Ethereum's Vitalik Buterin's misrepresentation of XRP"}, {"date": "2022-12-21 14:15:00", "entity": ["ftx", "safepal", "safepal", "ton", "safepal", "ton", "safepal", "safepal", "ton foundation", "safepal", "ton", "dwf labs", "telegram", "dex", "dex", "defi llama", "safepal open network", "telegram", "ton", "safepal", "safepal"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "SafePal, one of the leading crypto wallet developers, has integrated support for The Open Network (TON). TON was initially created by the Telegram team but later transitioned to an autonomous and fully open-source project after a U.S court halted its development back in 2020.\nFollowing the integration with TON, SafePal users will now be able to store and send the native $TON token within their hardware and software wallets. Additionally, it will be possible to directly interact with the Decentralized Applications (DApps) that currently exist on the TON blockchain. Later on, SafePal will further extend the support for $TON within its extension wallet as well.\nThis strategic partnership also features a grant provision by TON that will be geared towards enhancing the open-source infrastructures. Both SafePal and TON have committed to building a secure, open, transparent and interoperable network in preparation for the next phase of blockchain adoption.\n“We are happy to onboard SafePal as the first hardware solution on TON. Furthermore, we are excited about the prospects of SafePal and their journey to open-source, as this builds greater trust and resilience for the safekeeping of assets.\" said Justin Hyun, Head of Incubation at TON Foundation.\nNotably, the integration comes at a time when most crypto natives are looking for non-custodial storage solutions in the aftermath of FTX’s collapse. A niche that SafePal has specialized in since its debut in 2018; this wallet provider offers several crypto management solutions, including storage, swapping and asset management.\nAs a result of the growing demand, SafePal’s hardware wallet sales have increased significantly, with the platform’s native token $SFP also on steady growth curve over the past two weeks.\nThe team is currently planning to launch an open-source wallet program, allowing third-party developers to leverage its hardware wallet infrastructure which includes the SafePal mobile app, browser extension, and communication protocol.\nOn the other hand, the interest in TON’s ecosystem is also at an all-time high, the project recently partnered with DWF Labs which committed to invest $10 million. In addition, Telegram has launched a marketplace for auctioning tokenized usernames and channels on the TON blockchain, with $TON acting as the native transaction currency.\nAs of writing, $TON’s value is up by almost 50% within the past two weeks; the ecosystem’s fundamentals are also growing stronger, with STON.fi emerging as the pioneer DEX on TON. This upcoming DEX has already been integrated into DeFi Llama’s tracking system.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On the one hand, you have intense scrutiny from regulators, and on the other, you have a complex ecosystem that makes it difficult for users to understand the technology.\nThis creates an obstacle for blockchain projects, as they must not only provide innovative solutions but also find ways to make them more accessible and user-friendly.\nHowever, as time goes on, this problem is becoming exacerbated as the complexity of Web3 infrastructures grows. Now, there are countless wallets, exchanges, protocols, and other services to navigate. To make matters worse, communicating between the various blockchain networks requires specialized knowledge, which most users do not have.\nAs a result, a handful of interoperable solutions have been developed in order to bridge the gap between these various blockchains and open up the possibility of mass adoption. One such solution is Blocto, an innovative, chain-agnostic wallet that looks to bring some much-needed simplicity and user-friendliness to the space.\nMeet Blocto: Opening the gateway to mass adoption\nBlocto is a cross-chain wallet that allows users to store, use, and manage multiple types of digital assets in a single platform. It provides an easy-to-use interface that lets users access the blockchain without needing to understand its technical complexities, making it an invaluable resource for non-tech-savvy users.\nCurrently, Blocto sits firmly within the top three projects built upon the Aptos blockchain, which has quickly established itself as one of the most promising and reliable blockchains in the industry. After launching in late 2022, Aptos is already renowned for its scalability, security, and speed, making it an ideal home for Blocto’s wallet.\nBy leveraging the power of Aptos, Blocto is able to seamlessly bridge multiple blockchains and provide a unified experience for users. It packs a host of features such as multichain asset management, decentralized exchanges, and advanced security protocols that make it easier than ever for users to manage digital assets.\nDuring Taipei Blockchain Week, Blocto co-hosted their BloctoCamp event with Aptos, where they brought together industry experts and thought leaders to discuss and debate the possibilities of Web3 solutions and the potential for mass adoption. It's no surprise that the key themes of the event revolved around user experience, security, and interoperability, with the overarching solution being a wallet that combines all these features into a single platform.\nBlocto CEO, Hsuan Lee, revealed, \"One key factor in user growth is the user experience, and this is something that has been valued a lot since day one.\"\nWith this ethos in mind, users can sign up for Blocto’s chain-agnostic wallet in just 30 seconds, thanks to the simple email login process. By not forcing users to set up complex and often intimidating seed words and key phrases, Blocto can ensure that its platform is accessible to the widest audience possible.\nOnboarding the next billion Web3 users\nBlocto has set itself the ambitious goal of onboarding the next billion Web3 users, and it looks like they are well on achieving this goal. With their innovative Web3 wallet already serving 1.6 million users on the Aptos network, they are well-positioned to bring in new users and drive mass adoption of the blockchain.\nOn top of this, the team is currently hard at work developing and educating key stakeholders within the industry, which will be crucial for achieving their goals. Investing in tangible efforts to help inform a new wave of users about the blockchain by hosting in-person and virtual events is also likely to prove invaluable as the company pushes toward its goals.\nDuring their recent Bloctopian Nite event (co-hosted with Flow), Blocto gathered Web2 and Web3 experts with the goals of collaborating and brainstorming ideas to bring blockchain technology to the mainstream. If the past events and the response they have generated is anything to go by, then Blocto looks set to play a big role in driving the mass adoption of the blockchain.\nWhat's next for Blocto?\nAlongside its wallet, Blocto has made sure to create a robust ecosystem that helps drive mass adoption in the Web3 space. This is made evident by the company's $3 million Aptos Ecosystem Fund, which is designed to support promising projects and ideas that will help promote more approachable blockchain solutions.\nBlocto is also continuing to partner with leading brands and IPs to create more accessible, user-friendly blockchain solutions. Their recent partnership with MotoGP and Yahoo Taiwan is a prime example of this, with both companies creating the MotoGP Ignition Marketplace and Yahoo NFT Store respectively. Flow, an ecosystem featuring popular IPs such as NBA Top Shot, is another partner that Blocto has recently joined forces with.\nWith all these partnerships, educational initiatives, and user-friendly solutions in place, Blocto looks set to lead the charge in bringing Web3 technology to a wider audience. Only time will tell what the future holds for this innovative startup, but the signs are already there that Blocto is set to play a significant role in driving mass adoption of the blockchain.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Probably, when Madoff started off, I'm sure his intentions were good,” Elliot Lutzker, chair and partner at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron, told Decrypt.\nThe same could perhaps be said of Bankman-Fried, says Lutzker. “Maybe the first year his intentions were good, but right now, everything about him is just common criminal.”\nThe sudden reveal of Bankman-Fried as a “common criminal” is striking—so much so that he was the only clear contender for Decrypt Person of the Year, because of how large he loomed in the industry throughout all of 2022.\nHow it started\nBankman-Fried got his start in 2013 as an intern at proprietary trading firm Jane Street Capital, a prestigious first gig for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology student. He graduated in 2014 and worked there full-time until 2017, focusing on exchange-traded funds.\nAfter a short stint at the Centre for Effective Altruism, he founded his own trading desk: Alameda Research. It was critical in generating what would become Bankman-Fried’s $26 billion fortune and reinforcing his image as a thoughtful, in-it-for-the-ideas, crypto savant. The trading desk gained acclaim for arbitrage trades that took advantage of the “Kimchi premium,” or the fact that Bitcoin often sells for more on Korean exchanges than it can be purchased for on U.S. exchanges.\nIn early 2019, Bankman-Fried was ready to grow his empire, founding international crypto exchange FTX.com in Hong Kong before he moved headquarters to the Bahamas. Up until its collapse, he spent millions on marketing putting his face on the sides of buildings, inking spokesperson deals with NFL quarterback Tom Brady, actor Larry David, and entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary. He spent lavishly on political donations and courting lawmakers.\nFTX billboard in San Francisco in August 2022. (Photo: Daniel Roberts/Decrypt)\nThrough it all, he regularly offered up sage-like takes on the market in Twitter threads.\n1) As promised: My current thoughts on crypto regulation.https://t.co/O2nG1VrW1l — SBF (@SBF_FTX) October 19, 2022\nAD\nAD\nSo it was a Shakespearean level twist that on December 12, a month after FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and Bankman-Fried resigned, Bahamian police arrested him. As of this writing, he’s being held in a Bahamian prison pending extradition to the U.S. to face criminal charges of conspiracy, money laundering, and fraud—as well as civil charges from the SEC and CFTC.\n“The quirk, the thing that's really something, is that real crooks that aren't in the public and don't speak out loud or anything—they don't register with the SEC or as a broker-dealer to cover 1% or 2% of their assets when 98 or 99% is offshore,” Lutzker said. “When you're trying to be under the radar, you don't want to register with the SEC or be testifying in Congress. I mean, he was out there. It's surprising it took this long for it to implode.”\nHow it’s going\nA huge portion of the chatter, memes, and speculation on social media in the wake of Bankman-Fried’s fall from grace comes from people who didn’t know him or have a vested interest in his companies. It’s telling who doesn’t want to talk about the FTX CEO since his arrest.\nMulticoin Capital, an Austin, TX-based venture capital firm that had as much as $9 billion under management in April, participated in FTX’s $1 billion Series B round in July 2021, when the company had an $18 billion valuation. In November, the firm, which also led the $20 million investment round in Solana back in 2019, published a lengthy letter (shared on Twitter by pseudonymous trader Soldman Gachs) detailing its exposure to FTX’s collapse.\nBut when asked for a comment by Decrypt, the firm declined.\nCrypto policy think tank Coin Center’s director of communications Neeraj Agrawal shared his personal thoughts about Bankman-Fried on Twitter, writing on Monday that U.S. officials were “protecting him by charging him with every possible financial crime all at the same time,” sarcastically playing off the conspiracy theories that officials have been coddling him. But he told Decrypt the organization had no official comment on the matter.\nThoma Bravo, founded by billionaire chief executive Orlando Bravo, did not respond to a request for comment on the founder of what it once called “the most cutting-edge, sophisticated cryptocurrency exchange in the world.”\nThere was no answer from early FTX investor and oftentimes rival Binance. The other holdouts include: Early investor Lightspeed Venture Partners; otherwise vocal critic Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA); and Sen. John Boozman (R-AR), who co-sponsored the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA) of which Bankman-Fried was so fond.\nFor what it’s worth, Decrypt was in the process of scheduling its own interview with Bankman-Fried right before he was arrested. Instead, it seemed timely to go through unpublished portions of a 2021 interview when he was being named Founder of the Year, and shared that FTX had increased its headcount faster than he anticipated.\n“The thing that drives our company is the actual work, not the management of it. The management can be a really good multiplier on some of that,” he said during a December 2021 interview. “But the single most important thing is the actual individual work and we don't want to push management as a form of prestige at the expense of people doing what they're good at and what ultimately brings value to the company.”\nAD\nAD\nIn the midst of almost every major crypto firm laying off employees or implementing hiring freezes in the wake of Terra’s collapse in May, Bankman-Fried wrote on Twitter that FTX has “10% as many employees as others, but when it comes to output, I would take on any of them.”\n11) We have 10% as many employees as others, but when it comes to output, I would take on any of them. We built FTX, originally, with two developers. Having 25 today allows us to scale. Never underestimate what each developer can get done in the right environment. — SBF (@SBF_FTX) June 6, 2022\nHe even bragged that some of the developers he hired, “were rejected by another employer” and “now produce more than that company's whole team.”\nAt the time, it sounded like a corporate culture that valued individual contributors over team leads and other forms of middle management. But now it seems to have contributed to what new FTX CEO John Ray III coined the company’s “paperless bankruptcy,” during a House Financial Services Committee hearing on December 13.\nRay has called FTX leadership, including and especially Bankman-Fried, “grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated.”\nEffective lobbyist\nBankman-Fried didn’t let his inexperience get in the way of anything, really.\nSince 2021, he has spent millions on political donations. But he wasn’t content to leave it at that—he’d become a regular fixture in D.C., hosting breakfasts for lawmakers and showing up at events to hold court on the crypto industry.\nWhile talking to Decrypt about what it was like operating around Bankman-Fried’s foray into lobbying, Blockchain Association Executive Director Kristin Smith was deliberate: FTX was never part of the crypto lobbying group.\n“Obviously, Sam personally spent a lot of time in Washington and had a pretty aggressive strategy that, quite frankly, was very different from the way the rest of the industry was approaching things,” she said. “And so, you know, from my perspective, it's a little bit of a silver lining that we don't have to deal with him on a regular basis anymore.”\nBecause FTX wasn’t officially part of the Blockchain Association, Smith wasn’t always in the room when Bankman-Fried was building influence in D.C.—hosting breakfasts with senators, going to happy hour with congressional staffers, setting up one-on-one meetings with individual senators. But she does know that a common theme emerged.\nAD\nAD\n“There was a situation when a group of lobbyists and advocates were meeting to have a strategy session, and he showed up in the middle of that and basically spoke for 45 minutes at us and then left,” Smith said. “And so I think my understanding is that a lot of the conversations were sort of one-sided. But at the same time, I think people were very interested in Sam. They thought he was approachable.”\nBankman-Fried’s brand of approachability veered into something of a spectacle. He famously slept on bean bags in FTX’s office and seldom joined calls without simultaneously playing a P.C. game, like League of Legends, spinning coins or shuffling a deck of cards.\nTolerance for his quirks evaporated after FTX. Listeners gave him flak for playing video games during a Twitter Space just hours before he was arrested.\nSBF admitted he is playing video games while on Twitter Spaces right now. So many people lost so much in his FTX scam, and he is playing video games in the Bahamas while he gives out half-baked answers to some of the most important questions people have. — Benjamin Cowen (@intocryptoverse) December 12, 2022\nThrough it all, Bankman-Fried’s Stanford University law professor parents have been in the wings to help advocate on his behalf and guide him. A recent New York Times report called Joseph Bankman a paid FTX employee who frequently flew to the company’s Bahamas headquarters. Ms. Fried, who built a political advocacy network, accepted donations from her son.\nHis brother was instrumental in guiding his philanthropic efforts, running the Guarding Against Pandemics lobbying group that he funded. Bankman-Fried also founded the FTX Future and Building a Strong Future funds, both of which have lost their management teams since FTX collapsed.\nBesides his family, Bankman-Fried kept a tight inner circle that filled the leadership roles at his companies. For a while, nine friends-turned-executives lived with him in his $30 million Bahamas penthouse. The inner-circle included Nishad Singh, former FTX director of engineering, and Alameda and FTX co-founder Gary Wang. It also included former Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison and FTX Digital Chairman Ryan Salame, both of whom are rumored to have been cooperating with authorities since the company’s collapse. Ellison and Bankman-Fried were at times romantically involved.\nLast year, Singh spoke to Decrypt about the qualities that initially drew him to Bankman-Fried, who convinced him to leave a job at Facebook to join Alameda Research and then FTX. In hindsight, Singh seems to be describing what drew the entire industry to Bankman-Fried before the illusion shattered.\n“The parts of him that were there at the time were his sort of undoubtable brilliance, his hyper quantitative reasoning, and his ability to sort of see reality clearly, numerically. And I think that was a really appealing thing for me to see at the time,” he said.\nDuring the 2021 interview, Singh went on to describe Bankman-Fried’s Excel wizardry and intense attention to detail.\nAD\nAD\nIt all now stands in stark and damning contrast to his more recent insistence in interviews that he didn’t knowingly commingle funds, didn’t know Alameda Research was borrowing FTX client funds at such a dramatic scale, and just golly-gee-whiz had no idea what was going on at this own companies."}, {"date": "2022-12-21 13:57:38", "entity": ["paxful", "ethereum", "ethereum", "youssef", "ethereum", "youssef", "bitcoin", "ethereum", "bitcoin", "t. co", "youssef", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "paxful", "usdt", "usdc", "eth", "ethereum", "##ssef", "bitcoin", "youssef"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Paxful, a global peer-to-peer trading platform, is set to remove Ethereum (ETH) trading from its marketplace.\n“We finally kicked Ethereum off our marketplace. 11.6m humans safer.

Ernst & Young denied any involvement in the funds’ movement.\nIn a statement Tuesday, the accountancy firm said that although it “worked with management and others to recover the Bitcoin transferred to these wallets,” the “private keys associated with the cold wallets have not been located despite the detailed review.”\n“The locked Bitcoin remained within the Quadriga cold wallets until December 16, 2022, prior to the unauthorized transfers being initiated,” it added. “The Trustee confirms that it did not initiate the transfers.”\nReached for comment, EY has not yet offered any insight as to who may have moved the Bitcoin on Monday and how they were mistakenly sent to the cold wallets back in 2019. Decrypt will update with any response.\nWhat was QuadrigaCX?\nQuadrigaCX abruptly shuttered in February 2019, leaving millions in customer funds stranded in apparently inaccessible offline cold wallets. The exchange’s late CEO, Gerald Cotten, had sole responsibility for moving funds offline—a security procedure known as “cold storage”—but the addresses of the cold wallets were apparently known only to him.\nAD\nAD\nAccountancy firm Ernst & Young was subsequently appointed to try and claw back losses on behalf of customers. It announced weeks later the exchange’s mistaken transfer of 103 Bitcoin, then worth around $500,000, to five different QuadrigaCX cold wallets that it claimed it couldn’t access.\nAmateur investigators were able to find five wallets that had received roughly the same amount—104.335 Bitcoin, the same amount moved on Tuesday—by way of several small transactions.\nAn alleged accomplice of Cotten, Michael Patryn, who reemerged in February 2022 under the pseudonym 0xSifu as part of the DeFi project Wonderland, said in response to ZachXBT’s findings this week that the funds had been transferred by a QuadrigaCX employee, “Alex,” acting under instructions from EY.\n“They claimed to have accidentally lost the funds by sending to defunct wallets. Now it's suddenly moving again,” Patryn said. “Wen competence.”\nSo...

The XRP community immediately reacted positively to the announcement, as the new service by MoneyGram is made possible through a partnership with Frente Corretora, one of Ripple’s partners in Brazil.\nHowever, Ripple is not mentioned by name in the announcement. The relationship status between MoneyGram and the fintech from San Francisco continues to appear complicated.\nAs the press release states, consumers can now use the company’s website to send funds from Brazil to family and friends around the world in near real-time. Recipients can receive the funds through the company’s various options, while the service comes with no transaction fees.\n“As we continue to execute our strategy to grow and expand MoneyGram Online geographically, I am thrilled to announce that our website is now officially live in Brazil,” said Alex Holmes, chairman and CEO of MoneyGram.\nHolmes added, “This is a significant growth opportunity for MoneyGram to capture market share in a country with one of the largest populations in the world.”\nIs The Partnership Between Ripple And MoneyGram Reviving?\nMoneyGram emphasized that the service is made possible through a partnership with Frente Corretora, a Brazilian fintech company. Frente Corretora aims to become the “Transferwise of Brazil” by using Ripple’s technology to offer low-cost money transfers, Crowdfund Insider reported in June 2019. A month earlier, the broker launched the “Simple” service in partnership with Ripple.\nAs stated at the time, the joint venture’s main concept is to make money transfers fast and seamless, while eliminating fees typically charged by banks. In addition, correspondents connected to the Front Exchange are expected to become exchange fintechs through the white label tool (Frente Corretora de Câmbio).\nHowever, the role of Ripple’s technology is not specifically mentioned in the press release by MoneyGram. Whether it plays a role is therefore pure speculation. The announcement does not show any evidence that XRP will be used.\nStill, the announcement is worth mentioning because of the complicated history between Ripple and MoneyGram. The two companies entered into a partnership in 2019, under which the San Francisco-based company acquired a $30 million stake in the company and allowed MoneyGram to use the XRP-based ODL service for cross-border payments.\nHowever, the partnership came to an abrupt end when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Ripple for violating securities laws in December 2020. As a result, MoneyGram suspended its partnership with the fintech company in March 2021.\nNevertheless, CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized at the time that both parties are committed to forging new partnerships in the future.\nAt press time, the XRP price bounced off the key support area and was trading at $0.3439.\nFeatured image from South China Morning Post, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-21 10:41:27", "entity": ["bitcoin", "indian express", "ftx", "indian central bank", "bfsi insight summit 2022", "royal bank of india", "das", "central bank digital currencies", "…", "das", "rbi", "central bank"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Indian central bank governor Shaktikanta Das said earlier today that crypto should be banned, and if allowed to grow, might cause the next financial crisis.\nSpeaking at the BFSI Insight Summit 2022, Royal Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das gave a speech where he highlighted that if crypto is not banned, and is allowed to grow, then he sees it causing the next financial crisis.\nWith the Indian government preparing to regulate cryptocurrencies, Das echoed the words of other central bankers and leaders of global financial bodies when he said that crypto had no underlying value and that it posed a risk for macroeconomic and financial stability.\nAs reported by The Indian EXPRESS, the banker warned:\n“Mark my words, next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies…After FTX episode, don’t think we need to say anything more on crypto,”\nThe governor stated that crypto came out of an idea to replace or bypass the banking system, and that adherents to crypto didn’t believe in a regulated financial world. He said:\n“They don’t believe in the central bank, they don’t believe in a regulated financial world. I’m yet to hear a good argument about what public purpose it serves,”\nHe went on to share his view that crypto should be banned and what he thought might happen should crypto be given the legitimacy of regulation:\n“It should be prohibited because if it is allowed to grow … say it’s regulated and allowed to grow … please mark my words that the next financial crisis will come from private cryptocurrencies,”\nOpinion\nGovernor Das is the leader of the RBI, the Indian central bank. As such he is duty bound to defend his bank and also the fiat monetary system of which he and his bank are a pillar.\nIf crypto survives and starts to grow again, it will put pressure on the banking industry given that the current state of the fiat monetary system could be likened to a huge house of cards ready to fall in on itself.\nPeople will want to get out and be able to put their wealth into something that is not state controlled and thereby open to all sorts of mismanagement, and which doesn’t rob them of huge chunks of their purchasing power at an ever-increasing rate.\nWith the exception of Bitcoin, most cryptocurrencies have still not done the job of providing a bomb proof shelter against financial loss, even though many innovations have come out of them.\nHowever, this kind of entrepreneurialism and innovation needs to continue given that all that is going to come out of the banking system are central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).\nIf central banks can enforce this system then monetary freedom will be lost. Governor Das is using his position to cast mud into already muddy waters in an effort to strengthen public perception that crypto is not to be trusted.

The inability to fill withdrawals was a direct sign of the insolvency of the company, which could not operate without receiving an emergency $1 billion loan.\nDespite getting an emergency loan, the volatility crisis must be still going on in Silbert's empire. The massive outflow of funds and increased selling pressure on the mentioned assets is a direct confirmation of this thesis.\nIn a similar way to FTX or any other entity that might have issues with liquidity, the company is getting ready for relatively illiquid and volatile currencies in order to maintain more resilience in case a considerable amount of liquidity is needed.\nUnfortunately, assets are still losing their value at a fast pace while the market's liquidity and volatility remain at a moderate level.

CORZ is still generating cash flow, but it is not enough to pay off the financing debt from the machine lease.\nTherefore, the company will not be liquidated for the time being, but will try to continue operating as usual while reaching an agreement with the holders of senior promissory bills, who hold the majority of the company’s debt, a person familiar with the matter told the media group. Core Scientific produced a whopping 1,077 Bitcoins in the month of January, as was revealed at the beginning of the year.\nHowever, in late October, the Bitcoin mining powerhouse disclosed that the drop in price and rising competition due to the massive growth in the hash rate had torn cracks in the company’s books.\nAustin, Texas-based Core Scientific issued an announcement that the company could run out of money by the end of the year and may file for bankruptcy protection. The situation has seemingly not improved since then, especially as the Bitcoin price continued to plummet following the FTX collapse.\nThe market capitalization of CORZ, which went public through a special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC), had fallen to $78 million by Tuesday’s close of trading. CORZ peaked in July 2021, when the Bitcoin miner had a valuation of $4.3 billion. Overall, the stock has plummeted a staggering 97.7% in the last year.\nWhat Impact Will The Bankruptcy Have On Bitcoin?\nThe impact on Bitcoin is likely to be limited for now. While Core Scientific still owns about 5% of the global hashrate, the company said it will continue to operate as normal. Just yesterday, the mining company reported that it mined 47.7 BTC on December 19 (within 24 hours). Therefore, a collapse in the hash rate is not expected.\nPossible effects on the Bitcoin price are also not on the cards. Even before the October warning, Core Scientific had already sold a large part of its Bitcoin holdings. At the end of October, it was revealed that Core Scientific held only 24 BTC and $26.6 million in cash. So a “colossal” BTC dump will not occur.\nAt press time, the BTC price was trading at $16,859, trying to break crucial resistance at $16,900. The price needs to overcome the $16,900 level to generate further upside momentum. Yesterday, BTC had temporarily climbed to $17,054, but could not permanently turn this resistance level into support.\nFeatured image from Brian Wangenheim / Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-21 06:26:41", "entity": ["dripdropz", "twitter", "ethereum", "l bitcoin mining", "stablecoins", "bitcoin mining", "coinbase", "ftx", "coinbase cardano", "coinbase", "input output", "cardano"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Coinbase has irked Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson by ignoring one of the leading proof-of-stake blockchains in its recent market report\nAfter Coinbase released its market outlook report for 2023, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of blockchain firm Input Output, felt that the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange had overlooked one of the industry’s most promising projects: Cardano. “Not a single mention of Cardano.

The payments giant is moving towards an automatic payments system using the Ethereum blockchain to achieve this.\nIn its proposal, it plans to leverage the Ethereum account abstraction which was first presented by founder Vitalik Buterin back in 2017. This account abstraction will allow transactions to be verified and validated on the blockchain using programmable validity, according to Visa.\n“This means that instead of hard coding validity conditions into the Ethereum protocol that will apply to all transactions in a generalized way, validity conditions can instead be programmed in a customizable way into a smart contract on a per-account basis,” the Visa proposal said.\nETH price recovers above $1,200 | Source: ETHUSD on TradingView.com\nBasically, Visa plans to create a single Ethereum account that will combine aspects of user accounts and smart contracts to produce a single “delegable account.” It tries to take the operations that are used in bank accounts and integrate those into self-custodial wallets to allow for automatic payments.\nIn this way, a merchant, for example, will be able to set up a smart contract that will allow customers to pay automatically from their self-custody wallets. This means bringing automatic bill payments currently only available via traditional finance infrastructure to a decentralized blockchain system. However, this is still only in the concept stage and is yet to be implemented, although the most recent EIP-4337 discusses this as a possibility.\nTo achieve this, Visa says it is working with external Ethereum developers. The work being done stretches beyond producing the aforementioned self-custody wallets but also involves increasing the transaction capacity and speed of the network.\nThis comes just two months after it was made public that Visa had filed trademark applications to produce a crypto wallet.

And it made progress in its plans to support that growth through zero-knowledge proof scaling technology.\nAD\nAD\nOver the past several months, despite crumbling confidence in the crypto space due to the collapse of Terra and more recently FTX, Polygon has attracted a wide array of massive, well-established brands that are building applications atop the Ethereum scaler.\nStarbucks, Instagram, Reddit choose Polygon\nOnline discussion community Reddit was among the major announcements, and it’s the first to show tangible results. Reddit rolled out “Collectible Avatar” NFTs this summer based on its Snoo mascot, and rather than charge money for all of them and make it a pure revenue play, the firm increasingly offered them up for free to its most active users as rewards.\nWithin a few months, a Reddit executive announced that users had created more than three million Polygon wallets to claim the NFTs. Now, more than 5 million of the colorful avatars have been minted across more than 4.3 million unique wallets—a meaningful surge of adoption, despite some corners of Reddit being famously anti-crypto.\nOther brands’ efforts, which are earlier in deployment or still to come, could potentially reach a much broader (and perhaps less online) contingent of users.\nMeta, for example, is rolling out NFT minting through Instagram, eventually letting its billion-plus users mint their photos and images on Polygon.\nCoffee giant Starbucks is launching a new NFT-driven rewards program that’s already seen “unprecedented interest” despite just opening up to beta testers. And Nike plans to put digital apparel on Polygon in early 2023. Even Donald Trump's NFTs are minted on Polygon.\n“Even in the wake of FTX, I don't see people pulling back. I see people thinking of Web3 as a core part of their strategic future, from a tech perspective,” Ryan Wyatt, CEO of Polygon Studios, tells Decrypt. “The conversations continue, and I think every single one of these companies that thinks about Web3 will think about Polygon first when making a decision.”\nWyatt adds that while Polygon Studios supports brands and partners through various means, whether it’s investment, strategy, or technical guidance, the ultimate goal is to become more and more hands-off over time.\nAD\nAD\n“The further along that we get in this, the easier these companies are going to be able to just self-serve onboard,” he says.\nPolygon pushback\nWyatt joined Polygon Studios, the business development firm supporting the decentralized blockchain platform, in March after leading YouTube Gaming for several years.\nAs a crypto industry newcomer, he told Decrypt previously that he saw a need for savvy Web2 tech veterans to pair with the Web3 minds behind Polygon, to better speak to companies considering moves in this space. He described that mixture as his team’s “secret sauce” in attracting brands that might have considered other platforms.\nBut amid the rise in major brands picking Polygon has come fresh backlash that goes beyond the oft-tribal disputes that spill out over social media. Recently, Polygon co-founder Sandeep Nailwal got into in a Twitter dispute with Mert Mumtaz, co-founder of Solana-centric startup Helius, over Polygon Studios’ investments and onboarding.\nI've been ignoring these comments but lemme do it, not for the ecosystems who are feeling defeated & jealous, but for @0xPolygon community. - Polygon comes from a humble background, even thinking of paying $20mn for one project scares us😂\nTho, I wish we had this much surplus https://t.co/MhbRK9sqcX — Sandeep | Polygon 💜 Top 3 by impact (@sandeepnailwal) December 6, 2022\n“Polygon uses the money to pay people to use the chain and acquire companies,” Mumtaz wrote, alleging that Polygon's core team pays builders to choose the platform. Nailwal defended Polygon and railed against Solana in a quote-tweeted thread, noting Solana’s downtime issues, and triggered a discussion that dominated Crypto Twitter for a couple days.\n“All this is not to say that Polygon is not open to strategic deals, but we are not stupid to give millions of dollars for free,” Nailwal wrote in the thread. “The truth is all brands want to build on Ethereum and not on half-baked L1s. Polygon is just a medium for them to access Ethereum.”\nThe thread drew input and criticism from across the industry as other founders and builders weighed in on the debate. Mike Dudas, founder of VC firm 6th Man Ventures, suggested that Polygon leadership wasn’t being truthful about its brand deals.\n“Polygon absolutely pays for enterprise deals,” Dudas wrote in a since-deleted tweet. “Many of the big names building on Polygon were encouraged to do so by financial support, among many other factors. That’s fine and great business, but don’t lie about it.”\nAsked about the role of financial incentives in bringing brands to Polygon, Wyatt tells Decrypt, “Polygon has a $100M ecosystem fund where we invest in developers of all sizes. While this strategy isn’t unique, as most of the major protocols were significantly funded in the last few years with a clear mandate to build and advance their ecosystems, the network effects have been substantial. Builders want to be where other builders are, and it's a key reason they continue to build on Polygon without other financial incentives.”\nAD\nAD\nAnd despite Nailwal’s criticism of Solana’s issues, Polygon has faced technical problems too. In March, the sidechain network went offline for approximately 11 hours due to a node issue. And last December, a surprise (and controversial) hard fork of the Polygon blockchain was executed to patch what was described as a “critical network vulnerability.”\nzkEVM incoming\nTo support its growing mainstream adoption ambitions, Polygon is also developing the technology to power projects creators of all sizes through its three zero-knowledge proof (zk) scaling programs. Such solutions roll up bundles of transactions on a separate chain and then commit them to the main blockchain (Ethereum), enabling much higher transaction throughput.\nThe standout among the pack appears to be Polygon’s zkEVM, which promises full compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine through an equivalent environment. As such, developers’ existing Ethereum smart contracts, wallets, and development tools can effortlessly utilize it.\nPolygon zkEVM was fully revealed this summer and launched its testnet in October, with the team claiming it’s the first zkEVM to have a public testnet with source code proving that it’s producing ZK proofs. The platform aims to handle 2,000 transactions per second (tps)—up big from 30tps on Ethereum’s mainnet, but still below Solana’s recent average.\n“Every researcher in the community agrees that zk is the future,” Nailwal tells Decrypt, adding that “intermediate technologies” of today like optimistic rollups are simply stopgaps.\nHe says that development on zkEVM, including testnet deployment, has already beat expectations, and that a mainnet implementation may not be far off. “I think we are very, very tantalizingly close to the mainnet, or some form of early mainnet,” Nailwal adds.\nPolygon has acquired and implemented three different zk scaling teams, with Polygon Zero and Polygon Miden rounding out the set. Nailwal says that taking a multi-pronged approach to zk models will enable more flexibility for creators as they look to scale their decentralized apps (dapps) to reach large audiences.\n“We are extremely confident—more confident than when we took these large bets last year—that these were done in the right way,” Nailwal affirms.\nA 'bright spot' amid price drops and bankruptcies\nAmid discontent from some corners of the crypto world, Polygon’s contributors and supporters keep building. Nailwal describes this year’s growth as “surreal,” and says that while the brand moves grab the headlines, he’s also seen increased activity from Web3-native builders.\nPolygon certainly hasn’t been immune to market woes. Its MATIC token is down 69% from the start of the year, nearly on par with the losses of ETH (-68%) and a few points worse than BTC (-65%), but dramatically better than SOL (-93%).\nAD\nAD\nIn weathering the crypto market decline better than many other top coins, aided by occasional pops recently tied to brand moves, MATIC has climbed to the 10th-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap. Nailwal describes it as an achievement for the ecosystem and his team, but says that Polygon builders and supporters can’t let it go to their heads.\nWyatt says that the crypto collapses of 2022 revealed “what had been perceived as the golden children of crypto [to] be complete scammers and frauds, and not represent this space.” Polygon leadership aims to focus on building, control what they can, and avoid “self-inflicted wounds,” he adds.\nPolygon’s growth in 2022 and ability to attract major mainstream brands has been a rare bright spot in an extremely rough year for the crypto industry. Wyatt’s proud of that distinction, but he doesn’t want that to be an uncommon attribute for crypto projects in the future.\n“I want us to be a bright spot every year for the space,” he says. “But I think for the space to truly grow and get to where we need it to, we need a lot of bright spots.”"}, {"date": "2022-12-20 20:16:49", "entity": ["shibarium", "shiba", "shibarium", "shiba", "shibarium", "u.", "kusama", "twitter", "shib", "##ba", "shibarium", "shibarium", "shibarium"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Shytoshi Kusama, a lead Shiba Inu developer, says that the Shibarium scaling solution might soon enter a beta testing phase\nShytoshi Kusama, the pseudonymous developer behind Shiba Inu, has posted on a Telegram channel that Shibarium, a layer-2 solution for the cryptocurrency, will soon enter its beta testing phase.\nOverall, the Shiba Inu community seems to be excited about the apparently imminent launch of Shibarium, but there was some disappointment after a much-hyped “special countdown.”\nAs reported by U.Today, the Shiba Inu team recently announced a “special countdown,\" which turned out to be a site upgrade rather than an announcement of something major such as Shibarium or any other new releases.\nIt remains to be seen when exactly the beta testing phase for Shibarium will begin and whether it will live up to the hype that now surrounds it.\nA layer 2 solution in blockchain is a way to increase the scalability of a blockchain network by shifting part of the processing load and related data storage away from the mainchain, allowing transactions to occur more quickly.

We will update this article if we receive a response.\nThe decision comes a day after FTX’s new management, currently embroiled in bankruptcy proceedings, declared Monday that it would potentially seek action in bankruptcy court to compel any recipient of political donations from FTX or its affiliates to return those funds.\nPrior to FTX’s spectacular collapse last month, its then-CEO Bankman-Fried doled out some $46.5 million to support political campaigns, according to nonprofit OpenSecrets.org. Although perceived as primarily supporting Democrats, Bankman-Fried recently admitted that he hid donations to Republicans and ultimately “donated about the same amount” to both parties.\nLast week, federal prosecutors charged the crypto mogul with eight criminal counts, including wire fraud and money laundering. Prosecutors also allege that Bankman-Fried violated federal campaign finance laws by misappropriating FTX customer funds to bankroll his lavish political spending spree.\nSince FTX’s collapse, multiple politicians—including Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), and John Boozman (R-AR)—have stated that they have made donations to charities equivalent to donations made to their respective campaigns by Bankman-Fried.\nSuch actions, however, won’t necessarily protect those politicians from actions on the part of FTX’s debt collectors.\n“Recipients are cautioned that making a payment or donation to a third party (including a charity) in the amount of any payment received from [FTX] does not prevent the FTX Debtors from seeking recovery from the recipient or any subsequent transferee,” FTX said yesterday.\nAD\nAD\nComplicating matters further is the fact that the overwhelming majority of Bankman-Fried’s political donations were made to PACs, which are technically independent fundraising organizations that bombard American elections with hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of ad spending every election cycle.\nIn 2020, for example, Bankman-Fried donated $5 million to Future Forward USA, an organization that in turn funded the Future Forward USA PAC, a political action committee that shelled out $70 million to support Joe Biden with a barrage of ad blitzes in the final weeks of the presidential election.\nThe White House refused to clarify last week whether it would return donations made to President Biden by Bankman-Fried. However, the Future Forward donations were never made to Biden directly, so the President is ostensibly not on the hook for them.\nFuture Forward USA, meanwhile, currently has only $53,000 cash on hand according to OpenSecrets, after spending over $180 million to influence election outcomes in 2020 and 2022."}, {"date": "2022-12-20 19:59:27", "entity": ["bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "Shortly after the ball dropped in Times Square on New Year's Eve welcoming in 2022, the cryptocurrency, blockchain and digital assets community rang in the new year with thoughts of mass adoption into the mainstream.

He wrote:\n“One of the key features is the programmability of currency which would allow central banks to set limits on how much you can buy, where you can buy it, when you can buy it and how much you can save.”\nHe also penned the following very worrying concern on CBDCs:\n“The biggest concern is the ability to create negative interest rates. This is not the same as the negative interest rates we’ve recently seen in the Eurozone. Whereas negative interest rates with traditional currencies effectively pay you to borrow, negative interest rates in a CBDC system mean any currency you don’t spend would be slowly destroyed. This would give central banks even greater economic control, the likes of which have never been seen before. The end game is the complete loss of financial sovereignty for the user.”\nA change on this scale, in how people make payments, has arguably never been seen in the history of the world. With very little in-depth media coverage of CBDCs, the vast majority of civilisation is not likely to be informed and educated on what is coming.\nOnce CBDCs are rolled out, there may be very few alternatives available to escape the iron grip of central banks.

But after prices and trading volume surged over the weekend, both metrics have fallen sharply as the hype around the disgraced former U.S. president’s project is apparently fading.\nTrump’s digital trading cards, which are minted on Ethereum scaling network Polygon, peaked on Saturday, December 17 with over $3.5 million worth of trading volume, per data from CryptoSlam. Sales price rose even higher on Sunday, with the NFTsselling for an average of just over $680 apiece, although total volume fell to nearly $1.95 million for the day.\nAD\nAD\nOn Monday, however, day-over-day trading dropped 57% to about $836,000 worth of ETH, with the average sale price falling to about $466. Today, the cheapest available Trump NFT up for sale on leading marketplace OpenSea is listed at just 0.21 ETH, or about $255.\nTrump launched his digital trading card NFTs last Thursday, with 44,000 of the NFTs selling for $99 apiece in the primary sale. Buyers were incentivized by the possibility of winning a meet-and-greet or dinner with the former president, amid other potential perks. Another 1,000 NFTs were kept back by the project’s creators, for a total supply of 45,000.\nDespite widespread mockery and criticism of the project—even from some of Trump’s own supporters—the project sold out within 24 hours and fueled secondary market demand. Since then, the project has racked up over $8.7 million worth of secondary trades.\nMomentum peaked over the weekend, with the floor price—or cheapest listed NFT—hitting 0.84 ETH (about $990) on Saturday. Prices rose and fell in a volatile market ahead of the NFTs being skewered on NBC’s late-night comedy show, Saturday Night Live. Just three days later, the floor price has fallen 74% when measured in USD.\nTrump’s digital trading cards project is ranked only 10th on CryptoSlam’s list of the top-selling projects over the last 24 hours. It has about $472,000 worth of sales during that span, while the Bored Ape Yacht Club tops the list with $3.8 million worth of NFT sales.\nBeyond it being a pairing of already-divisive subjects (Trump and NFTs), the project has also been criticized for apparently using stolen artwork for some of its cards. Furthermore, the 1,000 NFTs kept by the project’s creators appear to contain a disproportionate amount of the “rare” collectibles, prompting further skepticism from NFT observers."}, {"date": "2022-12-20 17:27:54", "entity": ["bitcoin", "bitcoin", "ekasi", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Unlike other places where bitcoin acts more like digital gold – or something to hoard as an investment or speculative instrument – several communities in South Africa, like Bitcoin Ekasi, use bitcoin as they would a traditional currency.

The bitcoins which had been previously thought to be inaccessible were mysteriously moved out of multiple wallets, sparking speculations on who might have access to the wallets.\n$1.7 Million Leave Dormant Addresses\nThe collapse of the QuadrigaCX exchange, Canada’s largest exchange at the time, saw a lot of users lose their money. While the majority of the losses were attributed to mismanagement by funder Gerald Cotten, a good portion of it was actually because the wallets of QuadrigaCX were said to be inaccessible as it was believed that he had taken the private keys to the grave with him after his death in 2018. However, much of what was believed has now been turned on its head as five wallets linked to the exchange were just activated after four years of inactivity.\nThis was uncovered by on-chain sleuth ZachXBT, who is notorious for exposing crypto scammers on his social media. Zach had flagged the wallets on Monday, presenting a total of five bitcoin wallets that had moved approximately 104 BTC, worth $1.7 million. All of the BTC had been moved during the weekend to different wallets.\nThe connection of these five wallets to QuadrigaCX was made back in 2019 by researchers who had been trying to determine which wallets Cotten had kept the coins in. This was further backed up by the lack of inactivity on these wallets since the founder died.\nBTC jumps above $16,800 | Source: BTCUSD on TradingView.com\nWhere Did The Bitcoin Go?\nAs of now, the $1.7 million worth of bitcoin is sitting in unknown wallets. None of the coins was moved to centralized exchanges, meaning that there has been no attempt to sell them. However, the resurrection of these wallets has sparked the flame of speculation in regard to who could be moving the coins.\nOne of the most popular theories is that the coins were those that had been accidentally transferred to the cold wallets of Gerald Cotten. The amounts are very similar (around 103 BTC), but there are also other theories making the rounds.\nAnother theory was that it could be tied to the recovery efforts of Ernst & Young’s team who were in charge of fund recovery for the exchange, but a Quadriga creditor confirmed that E&Y was not behind the move, according to CoinDesk. Add in the fact that about half of the BTC was sent to a known crypto-mixing platform, Wasabi, and it is highly unlikely that E&Y is behind the move.\nCustomers of QuadrigaCX who lost almost $200 million when the crypto exchange collapsed are yet to be made whole. E&Y attributes this to the fact that Cotten was the only one with access to the wallets and as he did not keep any clear records, recovering the coins has proven difficult.\nFeatured image from Bloomberg, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-20 16:48:09", "entity": ["ethereum", "starknet", "ethereum", "mainnet", "visa", "visa", "visa", "cbdc", "visa", "blockchain. com", "visa", "visa", "visa", "visa", "ethereum", "network", "visa", "ethereum", "visa", "coindesk", "visa"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Payment giant Visa on Monday published a paper that outlines how it could possibly in future collaborate with the Ethereum network on automatic payments.\nVisa has proposed a solution known as “account abstraction” that utilizes smart contracts to enable automated programmable payments on the Ethereum network.

The BOJ announced that it will drastically widen its yield curve control band to 0.50%. At the same time, it announced that it will significantly increase the number of government bonds it will buy each month.\nAccording to Bloomberg senior commodities analyst Mike McGlone, this trend could continue. McGlone shared his insights via Twitter and said that a “warm spell” is ahead for Bitcoin.\nAs the analyst notes, BTC has taken a beating as a risk asset in 2022 with most other cryptocurrencies, but “appears poised to resume its inclination to outperform.” This will happen when the U.S. Federal Reserve eases monetary policy and completes its pivot.\nBitcoin Is Set To Outperform When…\nAccording to the chart from a Bloomberg Intelligence report, the levels that BTC and the Nasdaq 100 stock index have been resisting have now turned into support.\nAccording to the analysis, the BTC price soared in 2020 and 2021 due to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, allowing it to outperform the stock index. McGlone further elaborated:\nAt a Bitcoin/ Nasdaq ratio of 1.5x on Dec. 16, what’s been consistent for most of the benchmark crypto’s history is its declining relative risk vs. the stock index. At 2x, Bitcoin’s annual volatility at the end of 2022 compares with 4x at the end of 2021.\nIn the coming year of 2023, McGlone expects that it will be a matter of how much lower global economies fall. Investors should by no means underestimate BTC then, as the risk/reward ratio is in favor of the leading cryptocurrency.\n“Risk vs. reward appears to argue against under-allocating or estimating the propensity for Bitcoin to continue its trajectory toward becoming digital collateral,” McGlone claimed.\nIn other words, the Bloomberg analyst predicts that as soon as the U.S. Federal Reserve fires up its money printer again, cuts interest rates and returns to monetary easing, Bitcoin will “outperform” the rest of the market again.\nIn another tweet, McGlone predicted that the leading cryptocurrency will outperform the Tesla stock. “The near-certain decline in Bitcoin supply compared to the rising number of Tesla shares outstanding favors cryptocurrency outperformance when the rules of economics apply,” McGlone said.\nBTC Price At Crucial Level\nMeanwhile, the BTC price needs to crack the extremely crucial $16,900 level in the short term and could then have a strong continuation. If so, investors should then keep an eye on the next vital resistance in the $17,350 area.\nFeatured image from Kanchanara on Unsplash, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-20 14:00:00", "entity": ["ministry of finance", "parliament", "india ’ s reserve bank", "rbi", "union finance", "reserve bank", "pmla", "parliament", "government of india", "lower house of india", "bitcoin. com", "parliament", "minister of finance", "of state", "ministry of finance"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Indian government on Monday provided Parliament with clarity regarding its cryptocurrency bill as well as the status of investigations into crypto exchanges.\nThe government of India has provided information to various members of Lok Sabha, the lower house of India’s parliament, on its plans to regulate cryptocurrencies as well as investigations into crypto exchanges, according to reports by Bitcoin.com.\nGovernment Provides Updates on its Crypto Bill and Regulatory Plans\nParliament member Bhartruhari Mahtab asked the Minister of Finance to indicate “the current status of the cryptocurrency bill, which was due for being tabled during the winter session, 2021, of the Parliament” and the expected timeframe within which the crypto bill would be tabled and be open to public input.\nWithout providing a specific timeframe, Pankaj Chaudhary, minister of state in the Ministry of Finance, replied:\nCrypto assets are by definition borderless and require international collaboration to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Therefore, any legislation on the subject can be effective only with significant international collaboration on evaluation of the risks and benefits and evolution of common taxonomy and standards.\nThe Finance Minister was asked to state which ministry and/or department would be responsible for regulating cryptocurrencies and tokens. Chaudhary was also asked which department would regulate other forms of “virtual digital assets,” including NFTs, decentralised applications (dApps), real estate tokens, and other blockchain-based assets, to which he responded:\nCurrently, policy related to crypto assets and related ecosystem is with the Ministry of Finance.\nDetails Regarding Crypto Exchanges Under Investigation Also Sought\nMembers of parliament also requested “the details of crypto exchanges which are under investigation by the government for money laundering and tax evasion cases.”\nMinister Chaudhary explained to Parliament that India’s Enforcement Directorate (ED) is currently investigating numerous cases related to cryptocurrency fraud in which some exchanges have also been found to be involved in money laundering. He explained that as of December 14:\nProceeds of crime amounting to Rs. 907.48 crores have been attached/seized, three persons have been arrested and four Prosecution Complaints have been filed before the Special Court, PMLA, in these cases.\nIt was also revealed that under the Foreign Exchange Management Act 1999 (FEMA), assets to the value of $35,046,152 have been seized to date. Chaudhary added that 12 crypto exchanges have been investigated for evading Goods and Services Tax. A further investigation is also ongoing that involves eight cases, and an additional four cases have been closed on payment in which interest and penalties were levied.\nIndia’s Stance on Cryptocurrencies\nMinister Chaudhary also made it clear:\nCurrently, crypto assets are unregulated in India. The government does not register crypto exchanges.\nAlthough cryptocurrencies are extremely popular in the country, India’s Reserve Bank (RBI) is seeking a total ban on cryptocurrencies. The country has been vocal on its stance regarding crypto assets and maintains that they should be prohibited given their potential to threaten the country’s financial stability. The industry has been stifled since a 30% capital gains tax was imposed by union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in March. Under this tax structure, citizens trading in crypto is to pay a capital gains tax of 30% on their cryptocurrencies. Additionally, they will have to pay a 1% tax deducted at source on every transaction. India and its Reserve Bank may be against cryptocurrencies as such but have embraced the blockchain technology that underlies it by launching a digital rupee pilot.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Many users suggested that the announcement could be related to the upcoming Shibarium upgrade for the meme coin.\n“Shibarium” is a layer-2 blockchain solution for Shiba Inu that plans to bring several improvements to the cryptocurrency’s ecosystem. A layer-2 solution is typically a secondary blockchain built on another network (the “layer 1”) that takes the load off the main chain by first performing its transactions separately, and then sending them back to the layer 1 in batches.\nThe upcoming Shibarium scaling solution will improve the efficiency of the SHIB ecosystem and will provide cheaper as well as faster transactions to the users. The network will run on a proof-of-stake consensus system, much like its layer 1, Ethereum. This means that Shiba Inu holders will be able to stake some coins and become a validator on the chain once the layer-2 solution is live.\nHowever, despite investors’ hopes that the countdown could be a buildup to the much-hyped Shibarium, the announcement turned out to be only an update for the official website.\nSome community members took to Twitter and expressed their displeasure about the reveal, causing developers to come out and address the situation. Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer on the project, apologized to the SHIB followers, noting that the dev fully understands how the countdown might have been misleading.\n“Although not in control of that, I apologize for any confusion. Stay tuned,” said Kusama. Trophias, a member of the team that worked on the SHIB website, commented: “We understand some may be upset as you were expecting an update on the much anticipated Shibarium. Realistically, we can’t launch everything all at once.”\nTrophias had actually only a couple of days ago hinted that the countdown’s reveal would be the website update, as the dev had tweeted, “first thing is to update our main website. It was much needed and this is our first step as we march towards Shibarium’s Beta launch.”\nWhile Shiba Inu holders may be disappointed about the reveal, there has also nonetheless been some positive news for them recently; SHIB was one of the three most-watched cryptocurrencies on Binance in 2022.\nWe present to you the most watched crypto assets in #2022withBinance 🤝 Which cryptocurrencies were you watching? pic.twitter.com/6RGXdVm59Y — Binance (@binance) December 18, 2022\nSHIB Price\nAt the time of writing, Shiba Inu’s price is trading around $0.00000841, down 6% in the last week.\nSHIB continues to consolidate sideways | Source: SHIBUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Ferhat Deniz Fors on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-20 13:01:27", "entity": ["mtdz", "klaytn", "polygon", "meta toy city", "mtdz", "oneplanet", "polygon", "sandbox polygon", "oneplanet", "meta toy city", "polygon", "derby stars", "tower token", "animoca", "oneplanet", "##planet", "oneplanet", "mtdz", "polygon", "polygon", "oneplanet", "oneplanet", "oneplanet", "twitter", "sandbox", "sandbox", "youtube", "instagram", "facebook", "polygon", "oneplanet", "sandbox", "network", "metato sandbox", "youtube", "sandbox", "meta toy web3", "mtdz", "meta toy world"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Seoul, Korea, 20th December, 2022, Chainwire\nNFT Marketplace powered by Polygon, OnePlanet, partnered with Sandbox Network to provide technical and ecosystem support for the global expansion of MetaToyDragonZ (MTDZ).\nSandbox Network is the most prominent YouTube Multi-Channel Network in South Korea with over 3 billion monthly views from its creator IP across gaming, entertainment, and sports industries.\nSandbox Network has developed its own NFT Meta Toy DragonZ on Klaytn and successfully connected creators to the Web3 community.

The Duma is to consider a bill to allow a domestic cryptocurrency market.\nIn a desperate bid to get around the harsh sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia, the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, will consider a bill that would legalise a crypto market in the country.\nAccording to a report earlier today in Newsweek, the bill would also look to legalise the mining of cryptocurrencies and their sale. The bill would be approved extremely quickly given that this would be in effect from January 1, 2023.\nThe bill states:\n\"Digital currency obtained as a result of mining can be disposed of by the person who carried out the mining of this digital currency on the condition that Russian information infrastructure is not used in conducting transactions with it, with the exception of cases of transactions carried out in accordance with the established experimental legal regime,\"\nAnatoly Aksakov, one of the authors of the bill, and chairman of the Duma Financial Markets Committee, stated that crypto mining had existed in Russia for a long while, but that it didn’t have regulation.

According to VeriSign’s Domain Name Industry Brief, the third quarter of 2022 witnessed over 349 million domain registrations. Additionally, a report published by Godaddy, an internet domain registrar and web hosting company, revealed that the average price of a domain name sold in the secondary market (from someone who already owns it) climbed up to thousands of dollars. In 2019, MicroStrategy bought Voice.com from the owner for a mouth-watering amount of $30 million. This year (2022), Connect.com was sold for a whopping $10 million.\nObviously Web3 domains are just a big new market at its very early rise. How to benefit from it? The advent of Web3 has also introduced a new twitch to the domain market, with Web3 domains like ENS already selling high in the market. For example, on September 22, 2022, a buyer bought “pjfi.eth” for 0.12 ETH or $161 and later sold it for 350 ETH or $463 200. Also, 000.eth bought for 2.6 ETH or $638 on June 10, 2020, was sold for 300 ETH or $317,000 on July 3, 2022. Not to mention that this is not a purchase to own. ENS sales domains based on the renting model like Web 2.0 does.\nW3DNA is a revolutionary Web3 domain name service that significantly improved on what the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is currently offering. While the ENS is built on only the Ethereum blockchain, W3DNA supports Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ethereum, and Polygon. You have already seen the profit margins of those that have purchased with the ENS. Now let us imagine what the future holds for an arguably more robust web3 domain registrar like W3DNA. It undoubtedly presents a good investment opportunity for those who understand that the future lies with Web3.\nMore Details about W3DNA Domains\nW3DNA is an NFT domain, name, and account deployed on Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and Ethereum blockchain protocols. After your registration with W3DNA, you will be automatically given a username in addition to an account. With such an account, users can receive payment in any cryptocurrency. You can opt to register your W3DNA domain in any language and choose any symbol you want including emoji. The W3DNA domain does not have any extension, and there are also no length limits from just one letter, sign, number, picture to infinity.\nHow W3DNA Works\nThe W3DNA offers users an NFT domain, a name, and an account, thus breaking new ground in Web3. The name provided by W3DNA gives users exclusive ownership. It allows name owners to store their avatars and other profile information they can use in W3DNA services, including social networks, decentralized messengers, etc. Additionally, the account will enable users to store all their crypto addresses, ensuring they can accept payment in any cryptocurrency of their choice.\nW3DNA is designed to free users from an obligatory assignment of any top level domain in the form name.com, .edu, .net, etc.. This approach ensures that two users do not have twin domain names, for example, \"sales.com\" and \"sales.net.\" The platform does not restrict users to particular symbols or languages. User can choose domain name in the same language that is native to the audience. By allowing users to Synchronized mint on three chains with an unlimited number of EVM chains to be integrated in the nearest future protect users from mistakes when receiving or transferring crypto assets.\nThe Advantages and Disadvantages of W3DNA\nAdvantages\nW3DNA does not have extensions (that is .com, .etc, .bsc, .net, .edu, .art), thus granting exclusive ownership until you opt to sell it.\nThe absence of extensions increases the investment value, blocking any other user from purchasing the same domain with a mix of letters from different alphabets or different extensions. The same goes for punctuation marks.\nYou can earn huge returns by reselling the domains on marketplaces like OpenSea or Rarible.\nUsers can mint their NFT domain only once on three different chains (BSC, Polygon, and Ethereum) simultaneously.\nYou only pay for the domain once and own it forever - there are no renewal fees in the future.\nDisadvantages\nSince W3DNA does not allow extensions, two users cannot share a name. For example, you cannot have names like Chain.com and Chain.io for two different owners. However, being an owner of Chain you can keep different websites of three different chains.\nThe price of domains increases based on the number sold. Starting at a basic $15 at the launch period the price will increase to a minimum of $30 within less than a year. Therefore, the longer you procrastinate buying a domain, the more likely you are to pay a higher price.\nHow You can Buy and Sell Domains\nBuying and selling domains is pretty straightforward, provided you have a good understanding of the processes involved. First, you must already know the W3DNA domain name(s) you want to buy or sell. Here is a step-by-step guide on buying and selling your domain on W3DNA.\nLog in to the W3DNA site and type in the domain in the language of your choice which you aim to buy and check if it is available.\nOnce you verify that this domain is available, the price for the domain is displayed.\nFinally choose a payment method from crypto, credit card, or payment service to pay for the domain. You can pay with USDT (Bep-20), BTC, ETH, or other accepted cryptocurrencies. You can also pay using your bank card.\nEarning Great Returns from W3DNA\nAs the introduction explains, you can make huge amounts of money buying and selling Web3 domains, just like the ENS where people spend as little as $150 on domains and then resell them for over $300k. Just think of the fact that in the case of ENS people are not reselling the domain per say they are reselling the right to rent it from ENS. From the W3DNA you can purchase unique and sort-after domains for as low as $15 and resell for as high as 10,000X in the future.\nImagine buying a Ronaldo or Messi domain for less than $50 and having to resell it for much higher amounts than the initial price paid. This is the opportunity that W3DNA has presented to you today. See detailed information here to learn how to buy and sell W3DNA domains.\nConclusion\nWeb3 domains are just beginning to gain popularity. Soon everyone will have their own domain wallet, and now there is a great chance to make money on it. The opportunity to invest and resell your domains in the future is a chance that cannot be missed.

All the while, the scope of the SEC remedies was not made public. This is now coming to light, according to recent documents.\nIn a document attached to James K. Filan's tweet, the SEC claims that \"a penalty equal to LBRY's full pecuniary gain of $22,151,971 was fair and reasonable under the circumstances.\"\nAccording to the SEC, LBRY's gross receipts for its Section 5 violation equaled the value it received in exchange for its sale of 280 million LBC from its premine and market-making activity on multiple crypto asset trading platforms. It approximates this to be over $22 million.\nThe agency seeks from the court a penalty on LBRY equal to its gross pecuniary gain to deter LBRY and others from conducting illegal, unregistered offerings. It highlights a portion of the Securities Act that sets forth three penalty tiers, adding that the imposition of a civil monetary penalty may also follow a three-step process.\nIn the first step, the statutory penalty amount, adjusted for inflation, for a violation by LBRY of each tier equals the following: for the first tier, $103,591; for the second tier, $517,955; and the third tier $1,035,909.\nThe second step was to determine the maximum penalty.

This was the third notable win for the agency, following the SEC’s victories against Kik and Telegram, while the Ripple case is about to be decided, also on summary judgment.\nAlthough the court’s opinion hardly broke new ground, relying on fact-specific analysis based on the Howey test, the LBRY decision continues a trend of courts focusing on the specific details to determine whether tokens constitute an investment contract based on a test that dates back to 1946. Meanwhile, the crypto industry in the U.S. is still waiting for proper regulation.\nThe SEC Seeks To Destroy\nIn the latest filing, the SEC has now reaffirmed its tough stance against LBRY and the crypto industry as a whole. James K. Filan, a former federal prosecutor and defense lawyer, referenced the SEC’s letter in which the agency claims that “a penalty equal to LBRY’s total pecuniary gain of $22,151,971 is fair and reasonable under the circumstances.”\n“The SEC doesn’t want to regulate crypto; it wants to kill it in the United States,” Filan said. As XRP community attorney and YouTuber Jeremy Hogan explained, the SEC is seeking an injunction against LBRY for future sales. Hogan further commented:\n[…] and on the next page, [the SEC] argues the Court can’t rule on future sales by Amici because they are too speculative. I think the Judge is realizing about now that this was never about protecting ANYONE.\nBill Morgan, another attorney from the XRP community commented on the SEC’s letter as an avoidable defeat by which the “judge has made a rod for his own back.”\nMorgan argues that the judge broadly classified any sale of LBC over a 6-year period as an investment contract without specifying the transaction. This now makes it difficult for the judge not to rule that future sales are also not investment contracts.\nGiven he did not want to rule on whether future sales by LBRY should be required to be registered because the present record did not explain why future sales should be treated differently, how can he rule future sales be injuncted on the same record.\nJohn E. Deaton, who filed an amicus brief in the LBRY case last week, denounced the SEC for calling the LBC token itself a security:\nLBC is a digital asset. Like any asset or commodity, it can be packaged and sold in an unregistered securities offering. This is why Nick Morgan for ICAN and myself for Naomi Brockwell filed the Amicus Briefs. We must fight this narrative at every stage.\nImplications For Ripple\nUltimately, the same stance of the SEC is evident in Ripple’s lawsuit. The watchdog’s goal is to declare all XRP token transactions as securities transactions from inception into the future, also independent from the primary or secondary market. If Ripple fails to highlight the differences in their case and prove the applicability of the Howey test, the blockchain startup could face a nasty end in the U.S.\nIf Ripple were to lose in the district court, the question would be whether the company would move to an appellate court and, if necessary, to the Supreme Court. The same is true for the SEC.\nAs Deaton recently stated, an appellate ruling has much greater significance in setting a precedent for the entire industry. The fate of Ripple will thus possibly be groundbreaking for the entire crypto industry to battle the overreaching SEC.\nAt press time, the XRP price remained in its downtrend and was trading at $0.3453.\nFeatured image from iStock, Chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-20 11:33:00", "entity": ["shib", "meme", "kusama", "shib", "shib", "shibarium", "trophias", "shiba", "shytoshi", "trophias", "shytoshi", "shiba metaverse", "trophias", "trophias", "shib", "u.", "shib developer", "shibarium", "shib dev", "shib metaverse", "shibarium", "shibarinum", "shiba inu", "shibarium", "shibarium"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "SHIB developer has posted what can pass for update on upcoming release of Shibarium\nDisclaimer: The opinion expressed here is not investment advice – it is provided for informational purposes only.

They’re a popular recent trend in which crypto projects are led by their communities, as opposed to some kind of centralized authorities.\nDAOs, as they’re known, are fully autonomous and transparent entities governed by smart contracts that set out their foundational rules, execute any agreed-upon decisions made by the community and more. Within a DAO, voting rights are generally based on how many “tokens” an individual holds. In most cases, any token holder is able to make a proposal regarding the DAO, its actions, the disbursement of its treasury, investment decisions and more. The rest of the community then gets to vote on those proposals, with the result being enforced by smart contract code.\nUltimately, DAOs are governed entirely by their members, who collectively make all of the most important decisions regarding the future of the project, including technical upgrades. In order for a proposal to be passed, it must achieve a predefined level of consensus to be accepted. In this way, DAOs are considered to be democratic organizations that can serve as an alternative to the familiar hierarchical structure seen within most traditional organizations. DAOs are all about community collaboration, with each individual member participating at some level.\nOne of the most elegant things about the DAO framework is the way incentives are aligned. By that, we mean it’s usually in each member’s best interest to be forthright about their voting decisions, approving only those proposals that best serve the interests of the project.\nAssuming that the protocol in question is healthy and robust and working towards something beneficial, it should slowly gather more users and boost the value of its native tokens. In this way, members of the DAO always get to share in its success.\nHow Do DAOs Work?\nWith most DAOs, the rules of the protocol are established by its founders, which in most cases is just a core team of community members. They create the smart contracts that lay out the DAOs’ foundational framework, which establishes the purpose of the DAO, the rules about how it operates, what is necessary for a proposal to achieve consensus, and so on. These smart contracts must be transparent, verifiable and publicly auditable in order to win the trust of new members.\nOnce the rules of the DAO have been formally written to the blockchain, the next step is to fund the DAO and figure out how to bestow governance.\nIn most cases, initial funding is achieved through token issuance, wherein the protocol sells governance tokens that equate directly to voting power. Those who’re interested in participating in the DAO can acquire these tokens, with the funds generated from the sale going to the DAO’s treasury.\nIn return for their investment, members acquire voting rights that are generally proportional to the number of tokens they hold. Once the initial funding stage is complete, the DAO is ready to be deployed and start fulfilling its purpose.\nMost DAOs also share some of the profits they generate with their community members, based on the number of tokens each individual holds. A certain amount of those profits is usually always directed to the DAO’s treasury too.\nHow Can DAO’s Generate Profits?\nDAOs can make money in multiple ways, through charging for access, services or a commission, or through various kinds of investments.\nFor instance, a DAO can vote to issue additional governance tokens and raise money that way, effectively charging new users for the right to access the DAO. One popular DAO that does this is FriendsWithBenefits, which describes itself as a group of cultural creators, thinkers, and builders who convene digitally and in real life to collaboratively shape the future of Web3. Individuals must own at least one FWB token to be able to access its community. However, it’s important to note that there’s a disincentive for existing token holders to issue more tokens, as doing so can dilute the value of their own holdings.\nBecause of this, many DAOs look to make money in other ways, such as by charging users for a service it provides. BanklessDAO, for example, charges customers for the consulting services it renders.\nSome of the more sophisticated DAOs in the crypto space rely on investments in decentralized finance as a way of making money. On a simple level, this involves investing in various DeFi protocols and “staking” different kinds of tokens to earn yield, or providing liquidity to decentralized exchange liquidity pools to earn a percentage of trading fees.\nOther DAOs have become so heavily invested in the space that they’re now actively accumulating tokens belonging to other DAOs that govern some of the most popular DeFi protocols, so as to accrue greater voting rights and direct additional rewards to themselves.\nFor instance, the so-called “Balancer Wars” has seen a number of well-known DAOs, including Olympus, Lido, Gnosis and Badger, work to accumulate veBAL tokens in order to vote on Balancer proposals that benefit themselves. They’re increasingly taking advantage of a DeFi protocol known as Aura Finance that maximizes the incentives for veBAL holders by enabling them to earn additional rewards in the form of AURA tokens, which means more profit to accrue even more veBAL in the long run.\nAura’s auraBAL token acts as a liquid wrapper for veBAL. DAOs can simply swap their veBAL holdings for auraBAL and earn additional rewards through AURA’s performance fees, as well as AURA tokens. Further, they can also deposit their auraBAL tokens into the auraBAL/(80/20 BAL/ETH BPT) liquidity pool on Balancer. For this, they can recieve auraBAL/BPT tokens that can then be staked on Aura Finance to earn a separate pool of AURA rewards for providing liquidity to other users.\nIf this all sounds complex… That’s because it is. The thing to understand though is that these DAOs are all competing for influence within the Balancer DeFi protocol so as to direct more rewards to themselves and increase their bottom lines by filling their treasuries. It’s a method that clearly works too, with Aura Finance rising from nowhere to become the 20th biggest DeFi protocol, just months after it launched.\nHow To Get Involved In A DAO?\nThe real beauty of DAOs is that anyone can get involved in one, so long as they’re willing to invest in it. Users simply have to identify a project of interest and establish that it is working as it should, and ideally generating revenue.\nOne thing to consider is that not all DAOs operate with the same purpose. Therefore, users should first identify the core function of any DAO they’re interested in joining.\nFor DAOs that are focused on technical governance, it’s necessary to understand what voting rights are bestowed on token holders and the kinds of proposals at stake. With Uniswap, for example, token holders are entitled to vote on how the fees collected by its treasury are distributed among themselves. However, with Compound, token holders are only allowed to vote on how the fees it generates are spent on bug fixes and system upgrades - they cannot vote to increase their own rewards.\nBoth Uniswap and Compound also use a part of their treasuries to fund other projects through DAO grants. Developers are free to apply for grants and highlight how their own projects may benefit the DAO itself. Then, token holders can vote on whether or not to fund the project, and if so, how much should be allocated.\nSome DAOs are less interested in governance of the technical aspects of the protocol, and instead more focused on treasury pooling and allocation. Take SharkDAO, which is a collective that aims to pool its members’ funds in order to acquire highly sought after NFTs that are too expensive for most individuals to acquire by themselves. SharkDAO has so far raised more than 1,000 ETH to acquire five “Nouns”, which are NFTs from a novel experiment in generative, code-driven art that typically sell for in excess of $250,000. It’s a unique approach that provides interesting opportunities for individuals who’re interested in leveraging the power of a collective.\nBefore getting involved in a DAO, it’s important to assess its transparency. The details of the DAO should be publicly available for anyone to read, with a continuous record of its voting. To ensure full transparency, the voting records of individual token holders must also be observable.\nParticipation is everything for DAOs, which rely on their communities to come up with interesting ideas that can help them to achieve their overall goals. Individuals with an entrepreneurial mindset should find this especially interesting, as they can freely submit proposals they feel can help take the DAO forward.\nThat said, the level of participation will vary from token holder to token holder. DAO members can take part as much, or as little as they want. They’re free to join the DAO’s Discord or Telegram chat room, for example, where they can participate in discussions and take part in ongoing projects, earning compensation for their contributions. Alternatively, someone can sit back and reap the rewards of being a token holder, without actively participating in the day-to-day running of the DAO. DAO members have the freedom to decide for themselves how involved they want to be.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This creates unnecessary risks, which are the last thing you would need on a volatile cryptocurrency market.\nThe discount to net asset value is not unusual for trusts like Grayscale; however, it usually stays below 10%, and even abnormal volatility on the market should not push it to the extent we are seeing on GBTC right now.\nTo battle current market conditions, Grayscale has been actively trying to convert its Bitcoin trust to an ETF and, as expected, failed to do so, as the financial regulator confirmed that the company's desire to transform would not be possible.\nAt press time, Grayscale's discount sits at 46.37%, while Bitcoin is trading at $16,837."}, {"date": "2022-12-20 09:34:00", "entity": ["cardano", "t voltaire", "cardano", "cardano", "voltaire", "cardano", "cardano", "voltaire", "cardano", "cardano", "dcspark", "cardano", "cardano", "cardano", "minswap", "wingriders", "sundaeswap", "cardano", "u.", "cardano", "polkadot", "cosmos", "ethereum"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Several important improvements to the Cardano ecosystem have been unveiled today by the various developers operating within it.

Voltaire itself, as explained by Hoskinson, is intended to be the latest stage in the development of the Cardano network and to set an example for the rest of the industry as to how decentralized management is done.\nNo third parties\nAnother major recent innovation is the development of a price index for Cardano native tokens by the dcSpark team. The idea is that the index can be deployed locally and for free, without the need for an API or third party. For reference, the number of native tokens on Cardano currently stands at over 7 million.\nYou can now run your own local price indexer for Cardano native assets 😍\nYou can run it entirely locally with no trusted API server to pay for!\n3 DEXs supported for now, but more may be added in the future 👍\nAnother successful Catalyst proposal by our team🙏 https://t.co/0khuz8Psiu — Sebastien Guillemot (@SebastienGllmt) December 19, 2022\nThe index already has the support of the three largest decentralized exchanges on Cardano by total value locked: Minswap, WingRiders and SundaeSwap.\nOutpacing competitors\nCardano remains one of the most actively developed projects in the crypto industry.

They publish the results, with some caveats (which will be unpacked below) to help investors understand a centralized exchange’s state of finances and whether they have enough funds to match customer deposits.\nSince the trend has emerged, tons of different kinds of attestations have been executed, with some instilling more confidence in a firm than others.\nMerkle Tree-based Proof of Reserves\nOne way to execute an attestation is via a PoR protocol that uses a Merkle Tree proof to integrate large amounts of data into a single hash and verify the integrity of the data set.\nUsing cryptographic proofs, the PoR protocol verifies the validity of user balances and transactions.\nCrypto exchanges may publish Merkle Tree-based PoR attestations at regular intervals, including on a weekly, monthly, or quarterly basis, in the form of snapshots. Alternatively, firms might provide real-time attestations available on their website.\nWhile snapshots may be sufficient to prove a crypto firm’s solvency at a set point in time, real-time attestations are considered to be superior when verifying an exchange’s reserves as they allow anyone at anytime to ensure that funds are indeed by an exchange.\nChainlink launches proof-of-reserves protocol\nChainlink Labs, the company behind the popular decentralized oracle network, is offering its own version of a proof-of-reserves system, which, it said, is “designed to help projects across Web2 and Web3 prove asset reserves through automated verification.”\nLaunched in 2020, with the first user being the TrueUSD stablecoin, the system connects Chainlink nodes to an exchange’s API, its vault addresses, as well as a proof-of-reserve smart contract that can be queried by any other account on the network to determine whether the exchange’s crypto reserves are equal to its liabilities.\nIts blockchain-agnostic system provides data on how much is deposited, borrowed, and staked at a particular protocol at any point in time.\nAD\nAD\nExchanges can also use Chainlink’s system to provide security around the guarantees that they cannot issue more tokens than assets stored in reserves.\nWhich exchanges have proof of reserves?\nSome exchanges and crypto lending platforms, including Kraken, Nexo, BitMEX, and Gate.io, moved to launch their proof of reserves before the implosion of FTX.\nEvents in November 2022, however, saw more trading platforms work towards having their own proof of reserves, which, depending on the exchange, varied in detail.\nThese included Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, which released a Merkle Tree-based system for Bitcoin and Ethereum, with OKX, Crypto.com, and ByBit taking a similar approach.\nCoinbase, on the other hand, said that as a publicly listed company, it already proves its reserves via audited SEC filings.\nOn November 25, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange, however, noted that “on-chain accounting is the future” and that it is exploring “various novel ways to prove reserves using more crypto native methods.”\nPart of the effort is Coinbase’s newly launched $500,000 developer grant program.\nThese grants are meant to support individuals or teams “who are advancing the state of the art in on-chain accounting, privacy-preserving techniques related to proof of assets or liabilities (including the application of zero-knowledge techniques) and or closely related technologies.”\nWhat are the concerns?\nWhile proof of reserves is clearly a step in the right direction, theoretically helping to ensure that customer funds are safe and cryptographically proving that the company has sufficient liquidity, it can also give users a false sense of security.\nThe reason for this is that by simply providing a snapshot, exchanges give an overview of assets held on the platform’s associated addresses; however, they—with few exceptions—do not disclose the company’s liabilities to customers, meaning users are required to trust the auditor’s attestation about the assets in question.\nThis may potentially lead to a scenario where an exchange uses its proof of reserves to appear transparent without disclosing its true solvency risk.\nAD\nAD\nThis is what Kraken CEO Jesse Powel recently highlighted, saying that attestations must have three components: A sum of client liabilities (auditor must exclude negative balances), user-verifiable cryptographic proof that each account was included in the sum, and signatures proving that the custodian has control of the wallets.\nPowell was especially critical of Binance’s November attestation, describing it as “either ignorance or intentional misrepresentation” and saying that “the statement of assets is pointless without liabilities.”\nMore controversy around Binance\nBinance moved to quell concerns over its state of finances by drafting the South African arm of the international audit, tax, and advisory firm Mazars to prepare an additional proof of reserve report.\nReleased last week, it said that at the time of assessment, Binance controlled in-scope assets in excess of 100% of their total platform liabilities.\nYet, the report drew more controversy, with experts stressing that the Mazars report means little without any information about the quality of Binance’s internal controls, such as its systems for keeping accurate books and records.\nMoreover, as highlighted in a recent WSJ report, the Mazars report was, in fact, a five-page letter rather than a proper audit report. It did not address the effectiveness of Binance’s internal financial-reporting controls, stressing that Mazars did “not express an opinion or an assurance conclusion,” meaning it wasn’t vouching for the numbers.\nMazars said it performed its work using “agreed-upon procedures” requested by Binance and that Mazars made “no representation regarding the appropriateness” of the procedures.\nOn top of that, the figures in the letter essentially state Binance’s Bitcoin is only 97% collateralized, with a Binance spokesperson explaining “the 3% ‘gap’ is due to BTC loaned to customers, through the margin or loan programs, who may have used tokens out of the report’s scope as collateral.”\nShortly after, Mazars, which had executed similar attestations for Crypto.com and Kucoin, announced that it would halt any work with crypto firms moving forward."}, {"date": "2022-12-20 09:13:18", "entity": ["eoas eoa", "visa"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "EOAs can initiate transactions, but CAs cannot.

TRON DAO has been actively seeking new development teams and startups interested in creating decentralized applications on the TRON blockchain. Existing projects built on other Layer 1 blockchains that have thriving communities and established MVPs are also desired. TDV was launched to support the best of both – the elite teams #BUIDLING in the TRON ecosystem AS WELL AS the proven projects able and willing to bridge synergistically into the TRON ecosystem. TRON DAO leaders believe in a decentralized, multi-chain future with seamless interoperability. For projects built on other Layer 1 blockchains, the chance to coordinate strategically for cross-chain functionality is ideal and will spur industry innovation toward mass adoption and recognition.\nThe purpose of TDV is to invest in promising blockchain-based startups, guide and collaborate with them, optimize their efforts, and then exit when the project team has been empowered for their next stage of growth. TRON demonstrated its commitment to decentralization in December 2021 when it transitioned to become one of the largest community-governed DAOs. Now, they hope to empower entrepreneurial endeavors with like-minded dedication. Their aim is to invest across a wide range of categories, all of which exist to develop blockchain-based utility via DeFi, GameFi, NFT, DAO, and Web3 experiences.\nAll applicants submitting to TDV will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. While the deployment of funds currently averages between $100K to $250K USD per project, the TDV team is open to negotiating more significant funding deals when it’s deemed appropriate. The expectation for applicants is to have a long-term vision for TRON-based development with a strategic outlook toward benefiting other TRON projects as well as TRON users. The incorporation of TRON-based tokens, the inclusion of other TRON ecosystem dApps and tools, the integration of USDD , or the involvement of BitTorrent Chain would be a major plus.\nAn example of a “perfect fit” for TDV would be later-stage projects:\nBuilt on any Layer 1 (including but not limited to TRON)\nWith a MVP, Testnet, or Beta ready\nPast pre-seed funding already with $500K+ raises\nAlready with committed investors\nBelieving they would have strategic synergy with the TRON ecosystem\nAlready, 45 projects have applied for TDV funding and are under review.

Justin Sun, the TRON network has continued to deliver impressive achievements since MainNet launch in May 2018. July 2018 also marked the ecosystem integration of BitTorrent, a pioneer in decentralized Web3 services boasting over 100 million monthly active users. The TRON network has gained incredible traction in recent years. As of November 2022, it has over 130 million total user accounts on the blockchain, more than 4.4 billion total transactions, and over $9.7 billion in total value locked (TVL), as reported on TRONSCAN. In addition, TRON hosts the largest circulating supply of USD Tether (USDT) stablecoin across the globe, overtaking USDT on Ethereum since April 2021. The TRON network completed full decentralization in December 2021 and is now a community-governed DAO. In May 2022, the over-collateralized decentralized stablecoin USDD was launched on the TRON blockchain, backed by the first-ever crypto reserve for the blockchain industry - TRON DAO Reserve, marking TRON's official entry into decentralized stablecoins. Most recently in October 2022, TRON was designated as the national blockchain for the Commonwealth of Dominica, which is the first time a major public blockchain partnering with a sovereign nation to develop its national blockchain infrastructure. On top of the government’s endorsement to issue Dominica Coin (“DMC”), a blockchain-based fan token to help promote Dominica’s global fanfare, seven existing TRON-based tokens - TRX, BTT, NFT, JST, USDD, USDT, TUSD, have been granted statutory status as authorized digital currency and medium of exchange in the country.\nTRONNetwork | TRONDAO | Twitter | YouTube | Telegram | Discord | Reddit | GitHub | Medium | Forum\nContact\nMedia Contact\nHayward Wong"}, {"date": "2022-12-20 09:00:41", "entity": ["ethereum", "ftx", "bitcoin", "gnosis", "safe multisig wallet", "safe", "argent", "devcon", "revolut", "robinhood", "ap ux", "safe", "ftx", "metamask", "ethereum", "argent x", "starknet", "safe", "daos", "vitalik", "ethereum", "devcon", "ethereum", "scw", "ambire wallet", "ambire wallet", "adex network", "ambire wallet", "newcomer", "robinhood", "neobank"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "In the aftermath of the FTX collapse, we can't help but wonder why an industry that was created so that you can be your own bank actually ended up trusting single bad actors with tens of billions of their own hard-earned money.\nBitcoin was created as a form of digital money that liberates us from banks, enabling true self-custody, protecting us from financial disasters caused by someone else mishandling your money. However, in reality, the norm right now is to keep your crypto on a centralized exchange, which is significantly less safe than using an actual bank.\nIt’s a constant cycle in our industry: newcomers place their trust in centralized exchanges, leaving significant amounts of funds, sometimes even their life savings, leaving them vulnerable to hacks, misappropriation, and even regulation-imposed account freezing.\nWhy do newcomers prefer centralized exchanges to self-custody?\nThe reality is, self-custody is hard.\nIn order to set up a self-custody wallet, you usually need to install a browser extension, write down a seed phrase and keep it safe. All of those sound relatively easy, but in a world where we’re used to signing up for financial services like Robinhood and neobanks like Revolut in mere seconds, those are a lot of hoops to jump through. It’s intimidating.\nAnyone who’s helped their friends set up a crypto wallet knows how unrealistic it is to expect most people to have the patience for this. The onboarding process of a centralized exchange is unarguably 10x easier.\nFurthermore, the seed phrase is still misunderstood by many - even by people with plenty of experience. The seed phrase is essentially one very large number that unlocks your wallet. But it is not only that - IT IS your wallet. If you lose it, there’s no recovery. Similarly, if someone else has it, they can spend all your funds.\nMany of the crypto \"hacks\" are actually social engineering exploits (see Bored Ape Yacht Club), where users are tricked into giving away their seed phrases. This works because there are legitimate cases where you need to input your seed phrase, such as restoring your wallet from it when you change your device, or when a software update accidentally wipes it. This is clearly dangerous UX.\nIn short, self-custody isn't really a solution: in it's current form, it’s more difficult, error prone and frankly risky to recommend self-custody to someone who’s used to the comfort of a centralized exchange.\nHow do we make self-custody easy?\nClearly, we need a solution that’s as easy as centralized exchanges, but as safe as self-custodial wallets.\nThe solution has been right in front of us the whole time. Vitalik Buterin has been talking about smart contract wallets since the beginning of Ethereum, most recently at the latest DevCon in Bogota on the account abstractions panel.\nTo understand why smart contract wallets solve so many issues, we must first understand how normal wallets work. They work through a very large number (private key) that you need to keep secret and to protect. The seed phrase is just a way to write this number down. The problem with this is that this is single factor authentication - if you lose it, your funds are gone, and it’s very easy for it to get compromised, either through social engineering or malware.\nBut what are smart contract wallets? Smart contracts themselves are pieces of code that enforce some sort of business logic on the blockchain itself. When applied to wallets, this means that the wallet itself can contain some sort of logic beyond the simple “secret number unlocks it” principle of normal wallets, allowing multiple functionalities that we’re familiar with from normal apps, such as two-factor authentication (2FA), account recovery, paying transaction fees in any token and many more. With the introduction of account recovery, safeguarding a seed phrase is no longer necessary. As such, onboarding can be optimized to be on par with modern fintech apps like Revolut and Robinhood.\nThey also pave the way for more advanced security features, such as spending limits and fraud monitoring, ensuring that anyone can keep their wallet safe regardless of their experience level.\nAlso, thanks to multi-factor authentication, wallets are protected from malware, as compromising just one device isn’t enough.\nWho is building this?\nThere are not that many wallets in this space: the technology is still cutting-edge and little understood by developers, but there have been recent big advancements. It all started back in 2018 with the Gnosis Safe multisig wallet (now rebranded to Safe) and Argent, which debuted at DevCon in Prague and presented the first user-friendly mobile wallet based on smart contract wallet technology. As of today, Safe safeguards billions of dollars of value, and has weathered multiple crypto storms without any issues. Safe has seen over $400 million inflows following the collapse of FTX, showcasing its dependability once again. But something has always lacked when it comes to rivaling the incumbent, MetaMask. All smart wallets were somewhat niche - Argent is mobile only and only supports Ethereum (there’s a separate app, Argent X, for StarkNet), Safe is focused specifically on multi-signature use cases, which is a great fit for DAOs and corporations. But what about regular retail use? Ambire Wallet claims to tackle this - it’s web based, cross-chain, and has a unique feature: email/password signup - which essentially allows the best of both worlds: the smooth user experience of a centralized exchange with the self-custody and safety provided by a wallet. Ambire Wallet looks like a newcomer to the space but it actually spun off AdEx Network, which had a built-in smart contract wallet since 2018. Since its launch in early 2022, Ambire Wallet has grown to over 100,000 signups, and supports multiple blockchain networks and Web3 apps.\nAre smart contract wallets the future?\nWe believe that for crypto to grow, it needs to rid itself of its dangerous and unwelcoming wild west nature. As the past years have shown, your coins are not safe - neither on exchanges, nor on regular wallets.\nClearly, a better solution is needed - and smart contract wallets seem to combine the best characteristics of exchanges and wallets - you are still your own bank, without any compromises to UX or inherent dangers or footguns.\nThis is why the Ethereum community has been talking about incorporating smart contract wallets for years - you’ll often hear “account abstractions”, which is a way to make smart contract wallets “native” on Ethereum and other EVM chains. Regardless of account abstraction implementation, smart contract wallets exist today and still offer all the aforementioned benefits.\nIt appears that the time for SCW adoption has never been better, and it can change the way we self-custody for good.\nAlso published here, and here."}, {"date": "2022-12-20 08:15:07", "entity": ["boj bitcoin", "bitcoin", "fed", "bitco boj", "ecb", "bitcoin", "btc", "istock", "bitcoin", "btc", "bank of japan", "boj", "boj", "central bank", "boj", "bianco research", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "ecb", "boj", "bloomberg", "gold", "bitcoin", "bank of japan", "bitmex", "ftx", "boj", "twitter. com"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Positive", "Positive", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Bitcoin price slipped further yesterday, falling below the $16,300 level.

However, a surprising windfall occurred when the Bank of Japan (BoJ) announced an unspoken pivot.\nThe BoJ drastically widened its yield curve control band to 0.50% and significantly increased the number of government bonds it will buy each month. In doing so, the central bank sent shockwaves through global markets after unexpectedly revising its policy to control the yield curve. Every economist had expected the BOJ to leave its policy unchanged.\nBoJ Sends Shockwaves Through All Markets\nAs Jim Bianco of Bianco Research noted, this is a decision of paramount importance for all markets. This decision is also essential for Bitcoin and the broader crypto market, even though it may not seem so at first glance. The crypto market still follows market trends and stocks. Moreover, risk assets like Bitcoin become unattractive when interest rates are at record highs.\nAs a result of the decision, the yen rose nearly 3%, to its strongest level since mid-August. Meanwhile, stocks, bonds and the dollar tumbled. The yen also made significant gains against currencies such as the euro, while gold and bitcoin rose.\nRemarkably, the share of Japanese government bonds held by the Bank of Japan, measured by market value, also exceeded 50% for the first time.

Powell is hawkish. ECB head Legarde (Madam Laggard) is now talking hawkish.

Currently, Meta is trading at $114.74, according to MarketWatch.\n“Meta began 2022 with a new name and a new vision for the future, and at Reality Labs it’s our job to bring that vision to life,” wrote Reality Labs CTO Andrew Bosworth in a company post. “We never thought it would be easy or straightforward, but this year was even harder than we expected.\nAD\nAD\n“Economic challenges across the world, combined with pressures on Meta’s core business, created a perfect storm of skepticism about the investments we’re making,” Bosworth explained.\nMeta, then Facebook, launched Facebook Reality Labs in September 2020.

Many anticipated updates to the Ethereum network are focused on tackling this problem. Proto-danksharding, for example, is an early version of a system that could one day radically reduce the amount of data needed to be securely analyzed to process huge swathes of Ethereum transactions. It is expected to launch some time later next year.\n“From a payments standpoint, most [blockchain networks] are not yet scalable enough to process transactions at a really high speed in a secure and trusted way,” Gu said.\nAD\nAD\nUntil networks like Ethereum can extensively scale, it’s unlikely they will be meaningfully integrated by major firms like Visa. But the payments company, which has been in regular communication with Ethereum’s core developers, is optimistic that such technological horizons are within reach.\nThat optimism offers a marked departure from the grimness of current mainstream sentiment on crypto, dominated in the last month by the continually unfolding demise of crypto exchange FTX and its disgraced founder, Sam Bankman-Fried.\n“It's very important to figure out what's the signal and what's the noise,” Gu said. “We're taking a much longer-term perspective on this technology. It may have real utility, and that’s why we’re here: to invest more, to do research.”\nIn October, the firm filed trademark applications indicating it was mulling a crypto wallet and a metaverse product.

Additionally, insurers are reportedly giving clients a questionnaire to fill out to determine if they had invested in the defunct crypto exchange or had held any assets there, according to the president of Hugh Wood Canada, Kyle Nichols.\nWhile some insurers have taken to provide an exclusion for clients with exposure in some cases, Relm, a crypto insurer, takes a more black-and-white stand.

Just shortly after FTX had imploded, there had been a reported increase in requests for coverage.\nOne digital wallet, Liminal, had quickly moved to take out a $50 million insurance with Lloyd’s of London, while Arabian Business reported that other firms were looking to do the same, naming Canopius, Nexus Mutual and Zurich Arch as some of the prominent names in underwriting crypto risks for crypto companies. The demand for more coverage also shines through in a $14 million Series A funding for Evertas, a crypto insurance firm.\nIn its report, Reuters raises concerns regarding D&O policies which are for legal fees in case lawsuits are brought against directors and officers of a company. However, in a case such as FTX which is being charged with fraud, it is unclear if these policies will pay out. Ziolkowski also said that D&O insurance coverage may now be limited to only tens of millions of dollars for the broader crypto market, compared to the up to $1 billion coverage for cold wallet storage providers not connected to the internet.\nFeatured image from Analytics Insight, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-19 22:48:50", "entity": ["dossier", "bankoff", "bankoff", "binance", "dossier", "bankoff"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "According to Dossier, an OTC called Bankoff is operating from an office owned by a company directed by Lugovoi's wife, Ksenia.

The unlucky ones—and there have been many—are facing liquidation, lawsuits, and jail time.\nAD\nAD\nThe contagion—or tendency for a financial crisis to spread to other institutions, markets, or regions—has been unforgiving and widespread.\nCrypto market capitalization has fallen from $3 trillion in November 2021 to $881 billion, according to CoinGecko. And somewhat unusually, at least for crypto, the story of 2022’s contagion begins with a nonprofit organization.\nTerra fails\nThe founders of the Terra blockchain network formed the nonprofit Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) in January to safeguard the TerraUSD stablecoin and protect its dollar peg. TerraUSD, which traded as UST, was an algorithmic stablecoin that was meant to hold steady against the U.S. dollar.\nUnlike collateralized stablecoins, like Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), UST was initially backed by nothing but code—a mint and burn mechanism linked to its sister token LUNA. When that mechanism began to show signs that it would likely not hold up, LFG came into the picture to build up a reserve to back UST—only it used Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, instead of cash.\nThat didn’t work.\nJust days before UST lost its peg to the dollar, spiraled toward zero, and sparked fear in the markets, LFG had made its biggest Bitcoin purchase ever on May 5: $1.5 billion worth of BTC, bringing the reserve’s total balance to $3 billion. That included other holdings, like LUNA, the Terra network governance token; AVAX, the Avalanche network token; and USDT and USDC.\nThe purchase was made with help from Digital Currency Group-owned trading desk, Genesis, and crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, LFG wrote on Twitter.\n2/ The OTC swaps included 1 billion $UST for $1 billion worth of $BTC with Genesis, and the LFG purchased an additional $500 million worth of BTC via 3AC. The acquired BTC brings the LFG’s total holdings to ~80,394 Bitcoins. — LFG | Luna Foundation Guard (@LFG_org) May 5, 2022\nAD\nAD\nTerra co-founder Do Kwon was adored by his supporters for dunking on detractors, calling them “poor” and saying of competitor MakerDAO’s stablecoin: “By my hand $DAI will die.” In interviews with the media, he bragged about the wisdom of using Bitcoin as a reserve currency.\n“For the first time, you’re starting to see a pegged currency that is attempting to observe the Bitcoin standard,” he told CNBC. “It’s making a strong directional bet that keeping a lot of those foreign reserves in the form of a digital native currency is going to be a winning recipe.”\nThen the price of Bitcoin tanked. LFG, the nonprofit, wasn’t able to save UST from ruin with its reserves. The Terra network, along with UST and LUNA, was the first behemoth to fall in 2022, as UST plummeted from $1 to $0.13 in less than a week.\nA lot of the firms that would eventually fall because of their exposure to Terra were in three camps, and some were in all of them: Companies that were equity investors in Terra, receiving shares in the company in exchange for checks they wrote to Terraform Labs; companies that had opened large positions on Terra’s high-yield staking protocol Anchor, where they were earning returns of up to 20% on their deposits; or companies and individuals that granted undercollateralized, or just plain uncollateralized, loans to firms that had invested in Terra or had large, leveraged UST or LUNA positions.\nAmong them: Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, who famously tweeted a picture of his new tattoo in January: A wolf howling at the moon along with a “Luna” label. He proclaimed himself a “lunatic” and personally thanked Kwon.\nTerra triggers 3AC collapse\nAfter Terra collapsed, Galaxy Digital projected a $300 million loss for Q2 and a 12% drop in its partner capital to $2.2 billion. When the results were released, the loss was even worse than it predicted: The firm saw a net comprehensive loss of $554.7 million, and partner capital was down 27% to $1.8 billion, according to a company press release.\nBut the next important domino to fall after Terra was the now-infamous Three Arrows Capital, also known as 3AC, for which Terra’s Anchor protocol had become a steady source of profits.\nCo-founders Kyle Davies and Su Zhu started 3AC in 2012, making them old-timers by crypto standards. At its height, the hedge fund was managing upwards of $10 billion. It was the firm that every startup wanted on its cap table and every institution was happy to lend to, often asking for very little or no collateral. Its reputation was that good.\nIn many ways, Terra was just big enough to force an even bigger player to topple.\n“The data suggests that FTX’s demise hasn’t been investors’ biggest issue this year,” the team at Chainalysis, a crypto compliance company, wrote in a recent blog. “Both the depegging of Terra’s UST token and the collapse a few weeks later of Celsius and Three Arrows Capital (3AC) drove much bigger realized losses for investors: $20.5 billion in the case of UST and a whopping $33.0 billion in the case of Celsius and 3AC, versus just $9.0 billion for FTX.”\nAD\nAD\nThree Arrows had been so successful that, over time, it began placing riskier and riskier bets, including a nine-figure position in Anchor, created by Terraform Labs head of research Nicholas Platt.\nAt the time, Platt envisioned the Terra protocol would become the gold standard for passive income in DeFi.\n“To generate yield, Anchor lends out deposits to borrowers who put down liquid-staked [proof-of-stake] assets from major blockchains as collateral,” he wrote in 2020. “Anchor’s yield is thus powered by block rewards of major proof-of-stake blockchains. Ultimately, we envision Anchor to become the gold standard for passive income on the blockchain.”\nAt its height, and right before Terra collapsed, Anchor had $14 billion in UST deposited. But that passive-income goldmine was, of course, unsustainable. And when the music stopped, investors rushed for the exit. Anchor’s implosion then precipitated the collapse of the entire Terra ecosystem.\nFor what it’s worth, as of this writing, Anchor still exists. It has $560 million worth of UST left and promises 16.26% interest on deposits.\nThe 3AC co-founders, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, would later confirm that they took a $200 million loss from their UST and LUNA positions. When Terra’s market turmoil sent Bitcoin crashing from $30,000 to $20,000 in May, it put 3AC under pressure to add collateral on all its loans or face liquidation.\n“What we failed to realize was that Luna was capable of falling to effective zero in a matter of days and that this would catalyze a credit squeeze across the industry that would put significant pressure on all of our illiquid positions,” co-founder Su Zhu told Bloomberg in July.\nAmong its illiquid positions was a large stake in the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which used to be the preferred way for investors to gain Bitcoin exposure without directly holding BTC—so much so that it sold at a premium to the underlying Bitcoin. When 3AC started buying up GBTC shares, it looked likely that the firm would be able to resell them and make a profit once the lockup period expired.\nIn fact, by January 2021, 3AC was the largest shareholder of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), having increased its holding to $1.3 billion. But the mandatory lockup period meant that by the time 3AC could have started selling its shares, the premium had disappeared. The firm was left holding a bag of GBTC that it couldn’t sell without booking a loss.\nTo compound that problem, 3AC used borrowed money—$3.5 billion was still outstanding when it was ordered to liquidate—to fund many of its positions. That included $75 million worth of USDC from Celsius, an undisclosed “large” loan from BlockFi, $2.3 billion from Genesis, and $640 million from Voyager Digital. The firm also borrowed from exchanges: BitMEX, FTX, Blockchain.com, and Deribit.\nAD\nAD\nWhen 3AC failed to meet margin calls, or requests to add more collateral to secure its loans, lenders began threatening to liquidate the hedge fund’s assets. Court documents from 3AC’s bankruptcy proceedings show that Derebit leadership tried repeatedly to get in touch with the hedge fund’s co-founders.\n“You really need to start communicating,” one of the Derebit executives said to Davies. “Deribit legal team is preparing for the worst now, including [a] plan of seizure of your assets and stocks. … Don’t do anything stupid and please communicate.”\nThe company later said on Twitter that even if none of the loans were repaid, it would “remain financially healthy and operations will not be impacted.”\nAnother of the company’s lenders, Blockchain.com, got what’s now become a famous quip on Crypto Twitter from 3AC executive, Edward Zhao—“yo uhh hmm”—when he told Zhao the company would need to call back portions of a loan made to the beleaguered hedge fund.\nFrom a real conversation between 3AC and one of their lenders @blockchain (out $270M) released today https://t.co/W4jvcdafHD pic.twitter.com/2B83CLxQGn — FreddieRaynolds (@FreddieRaynolds) July 18, 2022\nIn a matter of weeks, companies that had secured 3AC’s loans with collateral liquidated the firm’s positions. But that left the ones that hadn’t asked 3AC to provide any collateral—after all, it was one of the biggest and most successful firms in the industry—to serve default notices.\nUltimately, it was the default notice from Voyager Digital for $640 million that preceded 3AC seeking Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection on July 1.\nThrough all of it, FTX founder and then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried maintained a white knight veneer. He famously said in June that he felt that his company had a responsibility to help all the struggling companies (a sentiment he’d repeat on Decrypt’s gm podcast in August).\n“I do feel like we have a responsibility to seriously consider stepping in, even if it is at a loss to ourselves, to stem contagion,\" he told NPR. \"Even if we weren't the ones who caused it, or weren't involved in it. I think that's what's healthy for the ecosystem, and I want to do what can help it grow and thrive.\"\nAfter realizing big losses from 3AC’s collapse, BlockFi, Voyager Digital, and Celsius were circling the drain. All three companies sought help from Bankman-Fried.\nAD\nAD\nBlockFi accepted a $400 million revolving line of credit from FTX US, which included terms for BlockFi to be acquired for $240 million pending certain “performance triggers,” CEO Zac Prince said on Twitter. Voyager Digital accepted two lines of credit from Bankman-Fried’s trading desk, Alameda Research: $200 million cash and 15,000 BTC.\nWord got out that Bankman-Fried considered doing a deal with Celsius, but passed because of a $1.2 billion hole in its balance sheet.\nFTX joins the bankruptcy parade\nIn the end, it didn’t matter who did or didn’t get a bailout. All three companies have since filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nThat’s because FTX—the company whose CEO was shaming others for not joining him in helping struggling firms in the industry—was itself insolvent. What’s more, it was insolvent partly for the same reason as 3AC, Celsius, BlockFi, and Voyager Digital: Terra.\nAnalysis of on-chain data has shown that Alameda Research experienced a huge loss when Terra collapsed in the spring. To cover up the loss, client funds were moved from FTX to Alameda. The going theory, according to allegations from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, is that a fake client account was created to hide Alameda’s liabilities.\n“At least in part to remediate the risk that Alameda’s large liability would be discovered, at Bankman-Fried’s direction, FTX executives reallocated Alameda’s approximately $8 billion in liabilities to a customer account on FTX’s systems that Bankman-Fried would later refer to as ‘our Korean friend’s account” and/or ‘the weird Korean account,’” the CFTC wrote in its complaint.\nThe company seemed set on not disclosing its losses from Terra until things started to come apart at the seams in early November. Leaked financial documents from Alameda landed on Coindesk, and its report revealed that the trading firm had billions worth of illiquid FTT, a token issued by FTX, sitting on its balance sheet.\nIt was a glaring red flag that prompted Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, a former investor in FTX, to announce that his company would begin selling off its stash of FTT. At the time, Binance held roughly $584 million worth of FTT—more than 5% of the entire token supply.\nThe move spooked FTX investors and clients, and the resulting bank run on FTX drained billions from the crypto exchange in a matter of days. Binance initially announced its intention to bail out and acquire its struggling rival, but it ultimately backed out and said that FTX was “beyond our ability to help.”\nTwo days later, the biggest domino yet would fall: FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and Bankman-Fried resigned. But the contagion is unlikely to stop there.\nAD\nAD\nAlready, BlockFi—a company that FTX swooped in to save in June—has been forced to shut down and file for bankruptcy. More recently, Genesis, the crypto lending company owned by industry giant Digital Currency Group, has been rocked by the FTX fallout.\nAt the start of the year, Genesis along with 3AC were instrumental in helping LFG fill its reserve with the BTC meant to protect Terra’s stablecoin. But 3AC’s bankruptcy left Genesis holding $1.1 billion worth of bad debt. Now FTX's bankruptcy has forced Genesis to suspend withdrawals while it searches for $1 billion in emergency funding to help it fulfill the $900 million it owes clients, according to anonymous sources who’ve spoken with the Financial Times.\nDigital Currency Group, its parent company, broke its silence on its exposure at the end of November. In a letter to shareholders (published in full by CNBC), DCG CEO Barry Silbert wrote that the company has more than $2 billion in liabilities, itself having borrowed $575 million from Genesis that’s due in May 2023 and absorbing the $1.1 billion 3AC still owed when it filed for bankruptcy.\nThere’s still no sign of relief for Genesis or certainty that DCG can survive if its lending arm becomes insolvent. If Digital Currency Group falls, there’s no telling how far the contagion will then spread."}, {"date": "2022-12-19 19:01:17", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "The self-contradictions are funny in the Shakespearean tragicomic sense that saw Brutus turn tyrannical after trying to prevent Rome from slipping into a dictatorship at the hands of Julius Caesar.

The $520 million sum includes a $275 million penalty that will be paid to the agency for violating the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), while another $245 million will be refunded to affected users via the FTC over what it calls “dark patterns and billing practices.”\nAD\nAD\n\"Epic used privacy-invasive default settings and deceptive interfaces that tricked Fortnite users, including teenagers and children,\" said FTC Chair Lina M. Khan in a statement. \"These enforcement actions make clear to businesses that the FTC is cracking down on these unlawful practices.”\nThe record-setting COPPA penalty pertains to allegations by the agency that Epic Games collected personal data from children under 13 without notifying their parents. Epic also made things difficult for parents who wished to then delete that data, the agency claims, and did not always follow through once requested.\nFurthermore, Epic Games enabled voice and text chat by default for young players, yielding potential harassment from other users. As for the other settlement, the FTC alleged that Epic used a “counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration” to trick players into making unintentional in-game purchases to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIt also let children purchase Fortnite’s V-Bucks in-game currency without parental confirmation, and would block accounts for users who disputed unintentional purchases with their credit card company.\nIn a statement today, Epic Games acknowledged the settlements and said that it reflected evolving standards in the video game industry. The firm said that it has already implemented a number of changes in regards to both child protections and monetization practices.\n“No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here. The video game industry is a place of fast-moving innovation, where player expectations are high and new ideas are paramount,” Epic’s statement reads. “We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.”\nEpic’s metaverse\nFortnite itself is not considered a metaverse game, in part because it features a closed ecosystem. Users can purchase items like character and weapon skins using V-Bucks, but those items remain locked within the Fortnite game world. Likewise, players cannot bring in assets purchased in competing games.\nHowever, Epic Games has increasingly positioned itself as a key builder of the metaverse, as it said when raising $2 billion in April at a $31.5 billion valuation. Epic Games has joined the Metaverse Standards Forum (MSF) alongside firms like Meta and Microsoft, and is also building a kid-friendly, official LEGO-themed metaverse game world.\nAD\nAD\nThe metaverse refers to a future version of the internet in which users interact with each other using avatars within 3D environments. It’s believed that the metaverse will be used for all manner of activities, including work, play, shopping, gaming, and more.\nHowever, there are competing visions for the future metaverse. Web3 builders believe that the metaverse must be built using blockchain tech, enabling open and interoperable platforms that can utilize the same player-owned assets via NFTs.\nExisting Web2 giants like Meta and Epic Games have not yet detailed plans to build their metaverse platforms with Web3 technology, although both have dabbled in the space. Meta has integrated NFTs within platforms like Instagram and Facebook, while Epic Games allows NFT-driven video games to be sold through its Epic Games Store marketplace.\nLast week, Epic introduced special limited-access accounts for its games—including Fortnite and Rocket League—for children under 13 to use as “a new way for kids to join the metaverse,” apparently in advance of the expected FTC announcement."}, {"date": "2022-12-19 18:31:45", "entity": ["treasury"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "UK's Financial Services and Markets Bill Should be Passed by Spring 2023, Treasury Says\nThe Financial Services and Markets Bill that is currently being debated will give regulators more power over crypto.\nBy Camomile Shumba Dec 19, 2022 at 6:31 p.m. UTC"}, {"date": "2022-12-19 18:26:07", "entity": ["binance", "binance", "ftx", "bifinity", "binance", "binance group", "futurelearn", "binance"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "As questions began to arise about the transparency of Binance's finances, Jo Johnson, Boris Johnson’s brother, resigned from his post\nJo Johnson, the brother of former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was providing guidance to a Binance subsidiary after joining its advisory board in September, The Telegraph reports .\nThe former science minister resigned from his post last week as questions started to arise about the lack of clarity in the crypto giant’s finances and a deepening crisis within the crypto industry that was triggered by the FTX collapse.\nHe and former Digital Minister Lord Vaizey were both providing consulting services for Bifinity, a Lithuania-based payments startup owned by Binance, as noted in their Parliamentary records.

Studies show that 56% of customers are ready to pay more even when cheaper options are available, and 77% have stayed with their favorite brands for over 10 years.\nDespite a clear link between consumer loyalty and profit, the state of traditional loyalty programs is far from ideal. Centralized management, expiration dates, and inability to transfer or sell rewards to interested users are just a few of the problems experienced by loyalty holders of today. To add to that, being part of a brand's loyalty program today, requires users to track rewards via individual websites or applications.\nThe idea of adding blockchain to a centralized loyalty program is not new but MetaFlyers, a rising blockchain-based loyalty ecosystem, has everything in the making to disrupt the decentralized rewards world with their one-stop platform for brands and consumers (NFT project holders).\nHow MetaFlyers revolutionizes the idea of loyalty programs\nMetaFlyers tackles the most important issue with loyalty programs of today: ownership. After earning the rewards, the users can own, gift, redeem or sell them to others with little to no limitations. To claim the rewards, members have to hold $FEWL - a utility-based token that fuels the MetaFlyers platform. The only way to get $FEWL at the moment is by minting an NFT from the MetaFlyers’ collection.\nThe MetaFlyers marketplace doesn’t only benefit the consumers. It is the first-of-its-kind loyalty infrastructure for the Metaverse that leverages NFT technology and provides value for consumer brands, NFT project founders, and retail users all at once. By allowing brands to offer consumers (NFT project holders) unique offers on the MetaFlyers platform, Web2 businesses instantly gain access to blockchain users with high purchasing power and can save costs on managing customer rewards themselves. At the same time, NFT project founders no longer have to depend on secondary drops to provide returns to investors. By leveraging the real-world value mechanics of consumer brand partnerships, they can keep community engagement at an all time high.\nThe MetaFlyers team is most certainly something worth mentioning: the three founders bring a unique mix of experience in software & product development, loyalty management, finance, design & content creation, and extensive knowledge in the Web3 space.. The project has been created by Jeff Sherwoord (ex-Rakuten & LuxuryCard), Sam Snyder (ex-ESPN & Disney),and Doug Lorenzen (ex-partner at Moore Venture Partners).\nWhat does the future hold for MetaFlyers?\nThe MetaFlyers NFT mint will take place on December 20th, with ambitious plans ahead: a marketplace beta to go live in early Q2, will include a white-labeling solution for brands to independently provide offerings to their consumers direct.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

(art: Grant Kempster)\nIf there’s a DAO, there’s a whale—and it’s probably vying for domination.\nAD\nAD\nIn this case, Balancer has taken an interesting pivot against a crypto cetacean roaming its digital waters. After roughly eight months harvesting the popular DeFi project’s coin, Humpy has agreed to a peace treaty of sorts.\nYes, Humpy is really the name the community gave to this whale.\nBalancer is a portfolio management tool that lets anyone spin up a multi-token liquidity pool. Users can then assign specific weightings for each token in the pool, auto-balancing (hence the name) as traders swap coins.\nOne of the protocol’s largest pools contains 80% BAL (Balancer’s native token) and 20% WETH (Wrapped Ethereum). And if you’re interested in participating in Balancer’s governance, you’ll need to join this specific pool.\nIn exchange for depositing funds into the pool, you’ll receive “Balancer Pool Tokens,” which represent a sort of receipt that your deposit is indeed sitting in this pool. With those BPTs in hand, you can then lock them back into the protocol in exchange for Balancer’s governance token: veBAL.\nSimple enough, right? (And for a quick run through of ve-tokenomics, definitely check out our previous coverage of all things Curve Wars.) Curve was one of the first projects to launch this kind of token model.\nNow, with veBAL in hand, users like Humpy can vote to boost the amount of BAL token rewards that are also distributed in each pool to different liquidity providers on Balancer. Each pool on the platform has an APR, but that percentage is usually denominated in BAL (or a different DeFi project’s native token). This is yield farming in a nutshell. But with veBAL, users can vote to increase that APR and have it distribute even more BAL.\nAnd that’s what Humpy did. In a cycle of accumulating, locking, and voting, they were continuously able to use their substantial holdings to further boost BAL APR for the specific pools in which they were yield farming.\nHow Humpy farmed Balancer's depths\nIn one example, they spun up a Cream Finance (CREAM) and WETH pool, set the trading fees to 10% (pool owners also collect fees from traders using the pool), and then began using their massive veBAL voting power to point additional token rewards in BAL to their pool.\nAD\nAD\nMessari reported that “over six weeks, Humpy used the veBAL system to direct $1.8 million of cumulative BAL emissions to the CREAM/WETH gauge and, therefore, back to Humpy.”\nAnd, critically, Balancer only saw about $17,000 of that as protocol revenue.\nThis cycle was repeated over and over in several other pools, too. Each time, Balancer governance would rally to make amendments, voting against Humpy’s strategies and even coercing another very large veBAL-holding entity (Aura) to step in to fight back the whale.\nThe standoff concluded with a Peace Treaty in which Humpy has agreed not to increase their veBAL position and would “vote for pools that are beneficial to the long-term growth of Balancer.”\nWith the dust settled, and the whale tamed, now the question (at least on Crypto Twitter) is this: Was Humpy actually a force for good?\nOn the one hand, one entity was just about able to dominate the entire governance procedure of a $1.5 billion DeFi project and significantly benefit their bottom line.\nOn the other hand, Humpy also pointed out the flaws in how governance on Balancer was handled.\nLike a white-hat hacker claiming their reward, perhaps Humpy has earned his rewards for gaming the hell out of Balancer.\n“We've addressed the incentive misalignments but we will feel these effects for years potentially,” wrote Solarcurve, a governance delegate for Balancer, adding, “Hard to say if Balancer is better off without Humpy but, I'm confident without his presence there wouldn't have been the urgency to address the systemic issues.”\nIt’s a cutthroat crypto ocean out there, folks.

The first of these transfers involved 43,974,224 coins moving on the Ripple blockchain, worth almost $15.5 million at the time of the transaction.\nUsually, such large single transaction movements suggest that the whales are involved. Transfers from this cohort are generally the ones to watch for as the sheer volume involved in them can produce noticeable impacts on the price of the coin. Below are some additional details regarding this whale transaction that may provide hints about the reason behind it.\nThe facts about this whale transfer that took place on the Ripple network | Source: Whale Alert\nAs you can see above, the sender of this transaction was an unknown address, meaning that it was unaffiliated with any known centralized platform, and likely belonged to a personal wallet. The receiving address here was a wallet attached to the crypto exchange Coinbase, suggesting that this transfer was an exchange inflow.\nSince one of the main reasons why investors deposit to exchanges is for selling purposes, exchange inflows can have a bearish impact on the price. As the current inflow is from a whale, it could be a sign of dumping from this humongous holder, and could thus result in a decline in XRP’s value.\nInterestingly, at the same time as this transaction, another whale transfer also took place. Here are the details about this one:\nLooks like this transfer was even larger than the other one | Source: Whale Alert\nA massive amount of 46,888,932 XRP (worth around $16.5 million) moved in this transaction, and it seems like the receiving Coinbase addresses were the exact same between both transfers. The sending addresses, however, weren’t the same for the two cases.\nBut nonetheless, the fact that the transactions were triggered simultaneously is enough evidence that the same whale was very likely involved in both transactions. The two unknown addresses being different could likely be because the whale just kept their holdings separately in two different wallets.\nIf the whale indeed made this $32 million deposit to Coinbase to prepare for dumping, then it’s bad news for the XRP price, which had already been struggling in the past week, as the chart below displays.\nXRP continues to see decline | Source: XRPUSD on TradingView\nFeatured image from Todd Cravens on Unsplash.com, chart from TradingView.com"}, {"date": "2022-12-19 16:00:00", "entity": ["ignite multicoin capital", "solana", "circle", "lemniscap", "bramah systems", "verilog solutions", "hashlock", "fluidity", "fluidity", "arbitrage traders", "fluidity", "fluidity", "fluidity", "ethereum", "solana", "arbitrum", "polygon", "stablecoins", "usdt", "crypto fluidity", "ethereum", "fluidity", "stable fluidity", "solana devnet", "beta", "ethereum", "fluidity", "fluidity"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Crypto users who leave their Christmas shopping to the last minute might be interested to know that Fluidity’s spend-to-earn protocol is launching on Ethereum on December 19.\nDescribed as an “avant-garde DeFi yield primitive,” Fluidity reimagines the yield-generation model by rewarding users simply for wrapping stablecoins on the platform and subsequently using the 1:1 assets. As such, users have the prospect of receiving a windfall every time they spend Fluid Asset or conduct trading activities.\nTo date, Fluidity has been operating on the Solana devnet beta and Ethereum testnets, and 50,000 users have already explored what it has to offer. After the protocol debuts on Ethereum, it is expected to branch out to other chains including Solana, Arbitrum and Polygon.\nA Risk-Free Way to Earn\nAlthough alarm bells may ring at the notion that any protocol in the entire crypto landscape is risk-free, Fluidity is quite different from the yield farms that have traditionally made such claims.\nThe general principle is simple: users in possession of stablecoins exchange them for wrapped counterparts on Fluidity: for example, USDT would be exchanged for fUSDT. Thereafter, holders of wrapped assets earn rewards by using and utilizing them on-chain – through trading, sending, receiving, and swapping.\nYields are paid on a random basis, with Fluidity founder Shahmeer Chaudhry saying 50-70% of all transactions qualify for rewards that are split on an 80:20 basis between senders and receivers. What’s more, such pay-outs can range from mere cents to millions. Consequently, participants in Fluidity’s ecosystem have a major incentive to swap their stablecoins and interact using the wrapped version – which can be converted into the underlying asset at any time.\n“Four or five years ago, everybody said DeFi could be the use-case that brings in a billion users to crypto – but it actually turned out to be NFTs and GameFi,” says Chaudhry, whose experience encompasses game design and blockchain acceleration. “At Fluidity, we want to gamify how people think about spending money, and our long-term goal is to re-shape how people approach spending.”\nAlthough a relatively new project, Fluidity has quite a bit of pedigree. Last year, the venture came fifth out of 6,000 participants in Solana’s IGNITE hackathon. In a subsequent funding round it also welcomed capital from a slew of VC heavy hitters, from Multicoin Capital and Solana to Circle and Lemniscap. The protocol’s smart contracts have also been audited by no less than three firms: Bramah Systems, Verilog Solutions and Hashlock.\nChallenging the Liquidity Mine Monopoly\nThe brain trust at Fluidity believes that liquidity mining programs are inherently unsustainable, as rewards revert to mean over time, causing users to vanish in search of better interest rates. Fluidity, on the other hand, rewards users for common endeavors such as paying for goods or services or swapping one crypto-asset for another. The protocol can also be leveraged by arbitrage traders to optimize profits.\nGenuine users – those who display certain intended behaviors – not only earn TRF (Transfer Reward Function) rewards but also governance tokens that let them have a say in how the protocol operates. Merchants, meanwhile, can earn a cut of rewards simply by accepting Fluid tokens as a medium of exchange.\nThe annual commercial blitz that is Christmas will give Fluidity an opportunity to establish itself as a viable rewards system. The big question, of course, is whether the protocol can win the hearts and minds of seasoned liquidity miners who continue to chase high APY on their staked assets.\nDisclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The situation surrounding Genesis Trading, Digital Currency Group (DCG) and Grayscale, which is still unresolved after a month, is depressing the market sentiment around Bitcoin.\nAs reported by the Wall Street Journal, information has now leaked out again which might be a double-edged sword for investors. Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein said the company would explore new options to return a portion of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust’s capital to shareholders, as the GBTC currently trades at a record 49% discount to net asset value (NAV).\nThat option is up for debate if the company fails to convert the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an exchange-traded fund, according to a letter to investors.\nAs reported by WSJ, the option could include a tender offer for up to 20% of the trust’s $10.7 billion outstanding shares. A tender offer would be a direct appeal to shareholders to sell their shares at a specified price within a specified time period.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has repeatedly rejected Grayscale’s applications to convert GBTC into a spot ETF, which is why Sonnenshein may now be considering the move. In June, Grayscale sued the SEC just hours after its ETF application was rejected. Last week, the SEC responded to the lawsuit for the first time, reiterating its position in a filing.\nGrayscale accuses the SEC of double standards by allowing futures ETFs on the market and repeatedly rejecting proposals for ETFs that invest in spot Bitcoin. The SEC’s rationale is that futures ETFs are closely monitored by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In contrast, spot Bitcoin ETFs lack this level of government oversight, the plea states.\nWhat a partial sell-off of GBTC would mean for the market remains to be seen due to a lack of detailed information on the framework. But the breakup of GBTC, which holds more than 643,000 BTC, is among investors’ biggest concerns.\nMeanwhile, Sonnenshein emphasized:\nGrayscale products, including GBTC, remain safe, secure, and unencumbered. We remain steadfast in our belief that the conversion of GBTC to an ETF is in the best interest of investors, and we remain 100% committed to that endeavor.\nBitcoin Price Sits Above $16,700\nDespite the news, the Bitcoin price held steady above $16,700 at press time. As recently as Friday, the broader crypto market experienced a sell-off after rumors surfaced that DCG might sell assets such as NEAR, Filecoin, and Ethereum Classic on a larger scale.\nHowever, apart from falling prices, there was no evidence to back this up. Nevertheless, there were some crypto Twitter analysts speculating about a sell-off by Grayscale’s parent company.\nSeveral crypto coins related to Barry Silbert's DCG have been selling off aggressively this evening (FIL, ZEN, ETC, NEAR), leaving many speculators to wonder whether the selling is derived from DCG itself. pic.twitter.com/M9mkQrEI7q — Will Clemente (@WClementeIII) December 16, 2022\nAt press, the Bitcoin price was sitting at $16,720. Thus, BTC is at a critical level. Bitcoin needs to break through $16,900 and start a continuation to above $17,300.

Customers and creditors will have a vote on its closing conditions. The first court hearing that might authorize the deal was set for January 5, 2023.\nAs a token of “good faith,” Binance will deposit $10 million, which will help the crypto lender to cover some of its expenses up to $15 million.

Both parties had filed their more than 60-page reply briefs for summary judgment on Nov. 30. Now it’s wait-and-see for the parties involved until Judge Analisa Torres issues a decision.\nMeanwhile, the spotlight is on the LBRY vs. SEC case. Notably, LBRY lost its case against the SEC in early November. The impact of the decision on the broader crypto industry as well as the Ripple case is unclear so far.\nHowever, according to XRP community attorney John E. Deaton, who is representing 75,000 investors in the case against the SEC, the LBRY case could bode ill. The SEC made several references to the LBRY case in its letter to Judge Torres, apparently to establish comparability with Ripple.\nAn SEC victory would be extremely bad for the entire crypto industry. That’s why attorneys Nick Morgan, on behalf of ICAN, and John Deaton, on behalf of tech journalist Naomi Brockwell, have set out to ask the court in the LBRY case to allow an amicus brief to be filed, and to defend the crypto industry on a second battlefront.\nAs Deaton wrote in a Twitter thread, their briefs filed are “arguably more important than the amicus briefs filed in the Ripple case.” The SEC is seeking a permanent cease-and-desist order involving the sale of LBC tokens.\nContrary to the judge’s request, the SEC communicated that it would not provide clarity on secondary market transactions. Thus, the SEC stated that it will not issue a no-action letter regarding users or secondary market transactions involving LBC.\nImplications For Ripple\nDeaton notes that in his opinion, nothing has changed in Ripple’s chances of success in its legal battle with the SEC. “The cases are super distinguishable and are in different circuits w/ different controlling precedents. Plus, LBRY didn’t contest 2 out of the 3 Howey factors,” the attorney writes.\nHowever, there is an “overarching common problem” in both cases. Regardless of which token is involved, the common problem is the legal classification of the token itself and its secondary market transactions that are completely independent of a company, like Ripple or LBRY.\nEven if Ripple loses, the XRP token could continue to exist. However, this requires regulatory clarity, which the SEC does not want to provide in the LBRY case.\nIn his amicus brief, Deaton points to three facts that show this overreaching behavior of the SEC. First, no federal appellate court has ever held that the underlying asset that is the subject of an investment contract transaction is itself an investment contract.\nSecond, there has been no federal case holding that a subsequent transfer of an asset used in an investment contract transaction also constitutes a securities transaction. Third, Deaton points to the judge’s ruling in the LBRY case that characterizing LBC itself as a security violates Section 5 of the Securities Act.\nThe SEC’s lack of clarification for secondary market transactions could thus also become a concern for XRP investors too. Therefore, according to Deaton, clarification by court order is highly relevant. Deaton summarized:\nHopefully, the judge agrees to distinguish secondary market transactions and users of the platform. It will still remain only one district court judge’s decision, but it could be used to limit the SEC’s arguments against tokens themselves.\nAs of press time, the XRP price was trading at $0.3422, trending towards a two-month low at $0.3196."}, {"date": "2022-12-19 13:07:08", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "The bank said it has completed some phases of the trial, including refinement of the prototype and introduction for a limited number of participants.

Investors also have a low level of trust in exchanges, sparking massive withdrawals that also affected Binance.\nDespite the best effort of Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, to allay these fears, some crypto enthusiasts hold contrary opinions.

However, he also stated that the market crash could be beneficial since it would snuff out worthless projects.\nThe FTX drama disrupted activities in many organizations, including Genesis and BlockFi. Genesis suspended all lending services in the aftermath of the collapse. Other establishments, such as Multicoin Capital, Temasek, and Paradigm, recorded losses due to their exposure to the FTX exchange.\nMinerd, however, stated that the crypto industry would weather the storm and likened it to the internet bubble of the late 1990s. He noted that a washout similar to that period would occur, and there will be survivors.\nAccording to Minerd, the digitization of money is still in its early stages. As it grows, there’s a need for a proper regulatory framework to make it legitimate.\nMinerd had previously been bullish on bitcoin, in 2020 predicting that it could rise to $400,000. However, he pushed the prediction further a few months later, saying it could increase to $600,000.\nBy May 2021, he seemed to backtrack on his initial crypto sentiment, comparing the crypto market to “Tulip Mania” in the 17th century. In July 2022, he stated that BTC could fall to $15,000.

In his words, Nigeria needs an efficient and energetic capital market, and to achieve that, the country must align with global practices.\nThis development came about two years after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) banned crypto activities, mandating banks to shut crypto-related accounts.

The ex-president of Nigeria insists that passing the law doesn’t mean a total lift on the ban but a review of which part of crypto is within the CBN’s scope. Ibrahim believes the law will help them review the legality of crypto.\nHe further explained that the CBN could not monitor crypto investors initially because most of the accounts were foreign and outside its jurisdiction. However, all that will change upon approval of the Investment and Securities Act of 2007 amendments.\nAside from legalizing cryptocurrencies, there will be a clear regulatory outline on how the CBN and the Nigerian SEC will oversee digital assets.

She put forth the opinion that the two components are separate from each other.\n“Just because I sold you the orange grove as part of an investment contract doesn't turn the orange grove into a security,” she said. “The orange grove, plus the promises I made to you about how I was going to tend the orange grove and generate profits for you—that was the securities offering.”\nAD\nAD\nWhether or not a crypto asset itself is a security is something that isn’t addressed by the Howey test, said Peirce.\n“You can say, ‘Well, look, a lot of these initial sales sure look like securities offerings,’ but then the question is, is that token, is the crypto asset itself, a security?” she asked. “That's a much harder question to answer, and I think it's one that people answer differently.”\nThe agency’s reliance on the Howey test is also somewhat flawed, said Peirce, because of the interpretation's apparent permanence.\nIn 2018, the SEC’s director for the Division of Corporation Finance, William Hinman, said he believes Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities because they had become “sufficiently decentralized,” a threshold undefined by the Howey test.\n“We've said that orange grove is going to be treated as a security in perpetuity,” she said. “I don't know when it stops being a security, and that doesn't make sense.”\nPeirce said providing clarification on how a digital token could go from being considered a security to a commodity would address some criticisms that actors in the crypto space have with the SEC’s regulatory approach.\n“If we were more precise, I think that there would be fewer objections to applying the Howey test and saying, ‘Hey, that initial time when you sold it, that might well have been a securities offering,’ but that doesn't mean that the token continues to be a security for the rest of its life,” she said.\nWhether or not specific digital assets are considered a security is a matter that Gensler has largely tiptoed around since he was appointed as head of the SEC. Gensler has only publicly said that Bitcoin isn’t a security and refrained from commenting on other coins.\n“A lot turns on whether something is a security, and so that's why we have to get clarity around that question,” said Peirce.\nSince Peirce joined the SEC in 2018, she said there’s been “no real positive movement” on crypto regulation despite lots of conversation and efforts to better understand the technology, describing the lack of progress as frustrating. She also said the inaction of government is impacting the way people operate in the crypto space.\nAD\nAD\n“The wheels of regulation and legislation move very slowly, and I think that that can be both good and bad,” she said. “In the crypto world, we've seen for a long time that there's been a lack of clarity, which I think has led people to do things that they wouldn't have done had there been clear guidelines.”\nPeirce explained she wasn’t specifically thinking about crypto when she became a part of the SEC but gradually gravitated towards the technology as part of a focus on how the SEC was facilitating or inhibiting innovation.\n“I think it's great that people are challenging the way we've done things; sometimes those challenges are going to fall flat and sometimes they're gonna succeed,” she said. “But we just need to make sure that it's not regulation that's picking winners and losers–It's people who are picking winners and losers.”\nListen and subscribe to the gm podcast wherever you get your podcasts."}, {"date": "2022-12-18 20:44:50", "entity": ["surreal", "surreal", "sandbox", "huang", "metaverse", "dao", "facebook", "meta", "metaverse", "metaverse", "decentraland", "nintendo", "decentraland", "metaverse", "metaverse", "oxford", "decentraland", "brycent", "metaverse", "surreal", "surreal", "flipkart", "metaverse", "axie infinity", "surreal", "fortnite", "roblox", "surreal", "sandbox", "metaverse"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Billy Huang runs a metaverse advertising agency.

And while those endeavors have borne some fruit, they’re a far cry from fully launching brands into a futuristic realm of digital existence that, not too long ago, appeared poised to redefine the human experience.\nWhat went wrong?\nLast October, Facebook reoriented its entire, gargantuan enterprise towards dominating virtual worlds, changing its name to Meta to prove that commitment. The months following saw massive inflows of venture capital into metaverse startups. Metaverse platforms witnessed huge spikes in traffic. In the spring and summer, the metaverse dominated discourse and graced magazine covers; by the fall, “metaverse” was shortlisted as a finalist for Oxford English Dictionary’s Word of The Year.\nA few months later, though, the hype had all but collapsed, as had the populations of metaversal worlds. All attention was ripped away by the billion-dollar dominoes falling in the broader crypto space. Oxford’s Word of the Year, perhaps fittingly, ended up going to “goblin mode,” an online term for unapologetically greedy and slovenly behavior.\nAccording to experts like Huang, the problem comes down to user adoption. The metaverse promised to onboard millions to a new vision of the internet. But even those that ventured in haven’t stuck around.\n“For the most part this year, we have recommended very few metaverse campaign activations, and for good reason,” Huang said. “The users are not there.”\nWhy haven’t they shown up? Brycent, a prominent Web3 gaming creator and influencer, thinks far too many metaverse platforms and investors conflated the novelty of virtual hangout spaces (think digital parks and offices) with actual use cases for metaverse technology.\nAD\nAD\n“If there's just a place called the metaverse where we sit and do nothing but hang out and talk, that's no better than sitting in Discord,” Brycent told Decrypt. “That’s Club Penguin.”\nWhen the metaverse seized the world’s imagination earlier this year, digital crowds flocked to check out metaverse platforms like The Sandbox and Decentraland. Users shelled out hundreds of millions of real dollars for virtual land plots in those worlds. In February and March, Decentraland averaged 50,000 daily visitors, according to the company. But that figure soon thereafter plummeted by over 80%.\n“It doesn't really matter how many users you can drive to the landing page,” said Huang. “They're not going to convert, and they're not going to stay, because they're not going to see the value.”\nThat’s not to say, though, that immersive online spaces won’t be able to unlock new kinds of value and utility. They already have.\nJosh Rush, co-founder and CEO of Surreal, a virtual event platform, has seen great success this year shepherding companies into the realm of immersive digital advertising. Earlier this year, Surreal launched a pop-up metaversal experience for Flipkart, the Indian e-commerce giant.\nThe event was a smash success. Half of the users spent an hour in the space, an unheard-of retention rate for advertisers; the event’s purchase conversion rate was 400% higher than standard advertising campaigns.\nThe thing is, Rush wouldn’t tell you that event took place in the metaverse. It was held in a self-described “microverse,” a site built specially by Surreal to achieve a targeted objective for its client.\n“That’s not Sandbox or Fortnite or Roblox,” Rush told Decrypt. “It's something that a company built with a specific intent to market and hopefully sell something that people found valuable.”\nMicroverses like Surreal’s offer a vision for the future of virtual spaces in stark contrast to that of platforms like The Sandbox, which have long imagined the metaverse as a traversable constellation of many different metaversal platforms, each their own virtual neighborhood, all interconnected.\nTiny metaverses like the ones being built for major brands at Surreal are, by definition, incompatible with that dream. They are not interoperable, meaning they do not connect to any other platforms or sites. They are not virtual neighborhoods so much as they are virtual pop-up castles.\nAD\nAD\nDespite this, Sébastien Borget, COO and co-founder of The Sandbox, sees the success of small virtual platforms with tailored functions as beneficial, not antithetical, to the proliferation of a universal metaverse.\n“We're seeing a growing number of worlds, for different targets, niche audiences, and different platforms, which is positive,” Borget told Decrypt. “Having just a few large worlds—centralized or not—would not be healthy towards the construction of that vision [of a unified metaverse].”\nBut Surreal’s Rush has no interest in contributing to a unified digital playground called “the metaverse.” Rather, he sees the future of the space as a constellation of many walled-off metaverses, or microverses, each with tangible objectives and customized utility.\n“We have seen the pendulum swing away from million dollar investments in [platforms like] The Sandbox, where people aren’t really spending any time and there's really nothing to do, to microverses where companies can set up really engaging 3D experiences that can run as part of promotions or even be used by other elements of the business,” said Rush.\nTrends in the nascent world of metaverse gaming appear to be pointing the same way.\nWeb3 games like Axie Infinity rocketed to dominance last year, fueled by a “play to earn” model that incentivized users to participate in the game’s online world by offering them financial rewards. While Axie generated billions of dollars in NFT trading volume in 2021, the platform’s token crashed soon thereafter, calling the entire play-to-earn model into question.\nBrycent still believes gaming and Web3 are immensely promising bedfellows. But he thinks previous Web3 gaming endeavors failed when they tried to use games as a means to advance some universal concept of the metaverse, as opposed to leveraging Web3 tools to advance individual videogames.\n“You can't come in and just focus on tokens and floor prices, you’ve got to focus on storytelling, on creating incredible IP and incredible experiences,” Brycent said. “Because if you don’t, there’s no reason for any gamer to switch over.”\nIn this sense, Brycent also sees the future of the metaverse not as one communal utopian virtual space, but as a constellation of projects—here, great video games—boosted by NFT integrations and other blockchain-based applications.\n“The metaverse is the next generation of video games,” Brycent said. “Games and ecosystems with their own IP, that's where I think we're gonna see this sort of thing thrive.”\nAD\nAD\nSuch a reading of the metaverse’s state-of-play may bode far better for the world’s existing powers than for Web3’s native idealists and disruptors. If the metaverse is a means, not an end—if metaverse commerce boils down to branding, and metaverse gaming to storytelling—then what’s to stop corporations who’ve mastered those forms from expanding their dominance into the virtual realm?\n“Web2 companies are at a major advantage,” conceded Brycent. “You're going to see Disney, Nintendo, all these major game companies come in and say, ‘Alright, we're just gonna add blockchain technology on the backend, our gamers aren’t gonna know the difference, and we're gonna create amazing experiences.’”\nSuch a replication of Web2 power structures in Web3 would be a sad state of affairs for metaverse dreamers like Decentraland’s Creative Director Sam Hamilton.\nHamilton admits that his platform has taken a hit in the last few months, thanks to a metaverse hype cycle that he wishes never happened in the first place.\n“The eyes of the world came on us too soon,” Hamilton told Decrypt. “Honestly, we probably would have liked to have had another couple of years to improve the products before we got to that stage [of exposure], but it is what it is.”\nHamilton thinks these are only temporary setbacks, though. He’s unshaken in his conviction that years from now—in a decade, if that’s how long it takes—humanity will inevitably shift to an all-encompassing, virtual existence in the metaverse. And he’s doing everything he can to ensure that, when that day comes, Decentraland will have built the foundations of that digital world in a manner that prevents it from falling—like the physical world—into the hands of hyper-centralized corporations.\nHe concedes that Decentraland’s still-steady core following of around 10,000 people is an ideologically-motivated group that’s sticking around more for the theoretical promise of the metaverse than for tangible perks likely to attract average internet users.\n“The people who’ve stayed, they’re brought together by philosophies. They want to see the internet move in a different direction,” Hamilton said. “Most people don't really care about decentralization though.”\nHamilton can’t wait for those masses to change their priorities.\n“The truth is, by the time they do care, it will probably be too late,” Hamilton said. “So we have to maintain that philosophy, and we have to fight that battle, even though it makes our job harder.”\nAD\nAD\nCorporate-dominated, isolated microverses may well spell the immediate future for commerce and gaming in Web3, but Hamilton says he’s playing the long game.\n“If you projected the metaverse onto cinema, we're still in the days of silent movies,” he said. “We've got so many decades of innovation and invention ahead of us until we get to blockbusters like Star Wars.”\nThe thing is, silent movies packed theaters too."}, {"date": "2022-12-18 20:44:09", "entity": ["cz", "franklin", "trump", "ftx", "sbf", "riot games", "sbf", "sbf", "ftx", "sec", "twitter", "sbf", "twitter", "sbf", "sbf", "ftx", "nft", "duneanalytics", "nansen", "binance", "sbf", "riot", "twitter. com", "binance", "binance", "cry binance"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt\nJust when you thought the torrent of gossip was starting to subside in Cryptoville, this week crypto Twitter was slammed by a barrage of news that turned it back into its usual self: a festering hive of gossip, hot takes, judgements and speculation.\nAD\nAD\nTwo of the three bombshells dropped on Monday, giving people the whole week to chew on them.

ATM withdrawals will be capped at ₦20,000 ($45) per day, with cash machines only issuing ₦200 ($0.45) notes and smaller denominations.\nAD\nAD\n\"Withdrawals above these limits shall attract processing fees of five percent and 10 percent, respectively,\" the CBN said.\nThe new policy will take effect from January 9, 2023, about three weeks before the country phases out all old ₦200, ₦500 and ₦1000 notes.\nBanking on the eNaira\nNigeria’s phasing out of physical cash goes hand-in-hand with its push to encourage adoption of its central bank digital currency (CBDC), the eNaira.\nLaunched in October 2021, the eNaira was the second central bank digital currency after the Bahamas’ Sand Dollar, and uses similar blockchain technology to cryptocurrencies—though unlike cryptocurrencies, it’s ultimately overseen and managed by the country’s central bank.\nWhile not acting as a store of value in the same way as cryptocurrency, the CBN said the eNaira would help further promote financial inclusion. It’s also accessible on all bank apps and USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data), a “quick code” used on GSM cellphones to communicate with the network’s computers.\nNigeria's eNaira CBDC. Image: Shutterstock\nThe eNaira’s launch is part of a wider policy on the part of the CBN, outlined in a 2013 policy document that encourages the adoption of agent banking, mobile payments, promotion of linkage models that enhance cooperation between traditional lenders, the government and microfinance institutions, and the implementation of an aggressive push for financial literacy.\nThe bank said its new policy direction was in line with its cashless policy and that “customers should be encouraged to use alternative channels (internet banking, mobile banking apps, USSD, cards/POS, eNaira etc.) to conduct their banking transactions.”\nThe launch of eNaira also followed a crackdown by the authorities on financial institutions dealing with crypto—which prompted a surge in peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading in subsequent months.\nAD\nAD\nNigeria’s informal economy\nWith Nigeria’s largely informal economy powered by cash transactions, adoption of the eNaira has been somewhat tepid.\nA banker, Ahmad* [not his real name], told Decrypt that customers are not keen on using eNaira, even when they make electronic transactions, citing no clear difference between the value of naira and eNaira.\nIkemesit Effiong, head of research at Lagos-based socio-economic research firm SBM Intelligence, said the policy will hurt those it is supposed to benefit the most and encourage the hoarding of cash.\n“The new policy, while hailed as a path to increased adoption of cashless transactions, is likely to turn off customers from utilizing formal banking structures,” Effiong told Decrypt. “The thriving agency banking business, where POS (point of sale) kiosks facilitate cash withdrawals, will suffer as the new policy wipes off most of that business.”\nPOS kiosk operators, who act as foot soldiers for many banks in inner streets of major cities and hard-to-reach areas, have become an integral part of the banking system in the past few years, helping to bridge the financial inclusion gap. While acting as the endpoint for the formal banking sector, they largely feed off the informal economy.\nThe policy is “too drastic and does not favour many of us,” Adeolu, a POS cash point operator, told Decrypt. “Limiting how much people can collect will affect the commission we earn every day. It’s like CBN is taking food out of our mouths and killing our business.”\nAdditional burdens\nA digital investment platform, Rise, said that the many charges attached to the country’s cashless policy were burdensome. It explained that the country’s informal economy is largely cash-driven and not primed for cashless transactions.\n“Fifteen million Nigerian adults regularly engage in informal financial transactions, and in that sector, cash is king,” Rise said in an email to its subscribers. “This makes sense because, from entering danfo (minibuses) to buying suya (spicy meat kebabs) at night, many transactions don't have an effective digital payment alternative.”\nStill, CBN governor Godwin Emefiele said the policy is reversible, made in the best interest of Nigerians and should be seen “the way we have presented it”.\n“We will be reviewing from time to time how this is working because I cannot say that we will be rigid,” he said on December 7 after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari.\nAD\nAD\nCashless aspirations\nEmefiele said that the ramping up of Nigeria’s cashless policy was long overdue, noting that the country has not made significant progress since the policy was first launched in 2012.\n“We cannot continue to allow a situation where over 85% of cash that is in circulation is outside the banks,” Emefiele said. “More and more countries that are embracing digitisation have gone into cashless.”\nOfficials and operators in the Nigerian finance sector have long believed that going digital would help shrink the country’s large pool of the unbanked—and boost the economy. As of 2020, 64% of Nigerian adults were financially included, Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access (EFInA) said in a 2020 report. But while the country aimed to provide access to formal financial services to 70% of Nigerians by 2020, it could only cover 50.5 %. The report also showed that Nigerians aged 18-25 were more likely than older adults to be financially excluded, an important consideration when the median age of the country’s population is 18 years.\n“Although Nigeria has a higher proportion of banked adults than many comparator countries, it also has a high proportion of financially excluded adults at 36%,” said EFInA noted in its 2022 report.\nEncouraging a cashless society has ancillary benefits for the authorities, too. Taiwo Oyedele, fiscal policy partner and Africa tax leader at PwC’s office in Lagos state, said that going cashless might help Nigeria rake in more taxes, as more small businesses will “become visible to the tax authorities”. He explained that the policy will also enable tax authorities to “get the intelligence to track your income and net worth making it easier to fish you out if you are a tax evader.”\nRegardless of the central bank’s aspirations, Effiong said the eNaira may see slow adoption owing to a lack of trust in government institutions—including the CBN, which he said is necessary to power cashless transactions.\n“This new policy may be perceived by many as the government foisting unnecessary controls over how people use their monies,” Effiong said, adding that “customers are likely not to trust the intentions of the regulator and turn away from some of its initiatives, including the eNaira.”"}, {"date": "2022-12-18 18:50:15", "entity": ["trump", "fine print nft international", "trump", "collecttrumpcards. com", "reddit", "twitter", "trump", "trump", "trump", "shutterstock", "adobe", "shutterstock", "polygonscan", "nft", "trump", "nft", "trump", "opensea", "opensea", "trump", "trump", "trump", "surround trump"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Positive", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Despite widespread mockery for a “major announcement” from former U.S. president Donald Trump that turned out to be the launch of an official NFT collection, Trump Digital Trading Cards have nonetheless captured the attention of traders.\nThe collection spiked in trading volume after it launched on Thursday, to 5,548 ETH or over $6.5 million as of Sunday morning, according to OpenSea.

Musk then quickly implemented a new Twitter policy that bans any “any tweets or accounts that share someone’s live location,” with the only exceptions being in relation to “a crisis situation to assist with humanitarian efforts or in relation to public engagement events.”\nThe bans come as a part of a backpedaling effort to curtail live location sharing despite Musk’s previous statement that he would not ban Sweeney’s tracking account in the name of “free speech.”\nWhen one user countered that Musk was simply “responding to system inputs” by implementing the swift bans on such tracking accounts, Buterin took issue with such a justification.\n“Acting ‘quickly and decisively in response to catalysts’ when the action in question is banning things is the path to authoritarianism,” Buterin said.\nButerin also criticized Musk’s censorship of Mastodon links, a competing social media website, calling the move “really bad.” It’s unclear why Mastodon links are currently banned, though Mastodon’s official Twitter account was similarly suspended for sharing links to its version of the “ElonJet” account.\nTwitter did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment.\nAD\nAD\nThis is really bad imo pic.twitter.com/y69hqIfq1S — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) December 16, 2022\nIt appears that many Twitter users are against banning accounts for sharing user locations that are already public.

Returning for the Season 3 hackathon were the Web3, DeFi, NFT and GameFi categories, with each track winner receiving a grand prize of $60,000.\nIn the Web3 category, the winner was OpenATM, a free and open-source DIY ATM that enables Tron users to exchange fiat coins for TRX.\nThe DeFi category was won by Meson-To, which enables Web3 dapps to instantly accept USDT and USDC stablecoins from 16 different chains.\nThe NFT category winner was Lazara, which enables users to quickly mint AI-generated NFTs created using Stable Diffusion or DALL-E 2.\nThe GameFi category was won by Galaxy Throne, a fully-on-chain, sci-fi strategy game where users own their own planets and ships.\n\"We were thrilled with the standard of entries in the third season of the Tron Grand Hackathon 2022 and with the teams who participated from all over the world,” said Feroz Lakhani, Tron DAO partnership manager. “These innovative teams are creating projects with real-world utility that will introduce the Tron ecosystem to millions of new users.\"\nEcosystem and Academy tracks\nJoining the previous hackathon’s DeFi, GameFi, NFT and Web3 tracks for Season 3 were new Ecosystem and Academy tracks.\nThe Ecosystem track was aimed at welcoming Ethereum projects who are “looking to expand their reach” to the Tron blockchain, said Uhryniak. It was split into two categories—technical and creative—with first prize winners in each category receiving $15,000. The winning project in the technical category was WaveData, a decentralized marketplace for clinical data. In the creative category the winner was B4B.World, a Web3 influencer advertising platform with reputation-based rewards.\nThe Tron Academy track saw entrants convene in person on the Harvard University campus for a face-to-face competition at the Tron Hacker House.\n“I am proud to see Tron DAO create the Tron Academy program, allowing access to resources for anyone to be able to achieve their individual aspirations and reach their full life potential,\" said Tron founder Justin Sun of the Academy launch.\nAgain, entrants were divided into technical and creative categories, with the winners in each category receiving a prize of $15,000. The technical category winner, Pneumatic, took on the challenge of creating a solution for insecure group fund distribution, by which group contracts can transact with other group contracts without having to trust an individual to transfer funds. The non-technical Academy award was won by LSP (Tron: Legacy), a proposed Tron smartphone with a built-in cold wallet.\nThe community votes\nAlong with judge-selected voting, the Season 3 hackathon also included a community voting component, allowing those projects whose team members participated in the Tron DAO Forum to vote in the peer-evaluated selection of winners across each of the six tracks.\nThe winners were TronHub by TronNinjas (Web3), T-Boost by USTX (DeFi), Fuzzy Ocean (NFT), Turuverse by TuruGlobal (GameFi) and InterPool by Irruption Lab (Ecosystem), with each project receiving $10,000. The winning Academy project, which received a $5,000 prize, was Tronify.\nThree additional bonus prizes were awarded for Season 3 of the Hackathon. The Devpost Community Prize of $1,000 was awarded to Elk Finance based on popular choice voting by Devpost community members. The Project Engagement Prize of $5,000, awarded by the Tron DAO team, went to TronJoy, based on its close engagement with the Community Forum.

MEV relays act as a parallel channel that connects miners to bots that want their transactions included in a block.\nWhile many had hoped the merge would see the price of Ethereum, now the largest proof-of-stake blockchain rise, ETH is currently trading at $1269, down from $1629 the day after the merge took place, according to CoinGecko. Not helping matters are the crypto bear market and the growing list of companies failing after the collapse of TerraLuna, Celsius, and FTX.\nBlocknative relay and builders have contributed more than 18,686 blocks to Ethereum's mainnet, according to MEVboost.org.\nAD\nAD\nIn addition to the relay and block building, Blocknative offers other solutions, including Transaction Preview, Web3-Onboard, Mempool Explorer, Gas Estimation, and Transaction Distribution Network.\nBlocknative has also recently begun accepting transaction bundles from MEV searchers, enabling the production of even higher-value blocks for its connected validators.\n\"As the world increasingly moves on-chain, Blocknative remains committed to contributing meaningfully to the web3 ecosystem through real-time access to pre-chain data, increased transaction transparency, and web-scale infrastructure availability at each and every block,\" Cutler said in a statement."}, {"date": "2022-12-16 00:45:53", "entity": ["ftx europe", "ftx japan"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "\"The Debtors and/or the Businesses have been in active conversations with a number of regulators for the Businesses,\" the filing said. \"The licenses held by FTX Europe have been suspended along with its operations, and FTX Japan is subject to business suspension and business improvement orders.

The items will be 3D avatar wearables or augmented reality (AR) virtual clothing, and can be viewed on platforms including Instagram and Snapchat, according to a statement.\nAD\nAD\nWarner’s vast trove of popular artists across its various sub-labels includes major stars like Lizzo, Madonna, Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\nWhat remains unclear is to what extent crypto and NFTs might come into play through this particular deal. However, the label framed it as another example of a Web3 partnership, so there may be as-yet-unannounced NFT components to come.\nWMG is also investing in DressX as a part of the agreement, although the amount was not disclosed. Oana Ruxandra, WMG’s Chief Digital Officer and EVP, Business Development, explained that the firm’s interest in DressX is due to a belief that life is only trending more digital.\n“The representation of our future digital selves will be as important and, if you’re measuring by sheer volume of interactions, maybe more important than how we represent ourselves physically,” Ruxandra said in a statement.\nDressX cofounders Daria Shapovalova and Natalia Modernova created the company in 2020 with the goal of “giving a meta-closet to every person in the world.” In July, DressX became the first digital-native brand tapped to release digital wearables in Meta’s Avatar Store, a move that didn’t sit well with some Web3 purists.\nThe DressX alliance caps off a string of Web3 deals for WMG in 2022. In January, WMG said it would host virtual concerts with its artists in The Sandbox, an upcoming Ethereum-based metaverse game A month later, the record label announced a partnership with Web3 gaming company Splinterlands to develop artist-themed blockchain games for fans.\nMore recently, WMG continued its bevy of Web3 partnerships by teaming up with NFT marketplace OpenSea to help artists bridge into the space, and made plans to release music NFTs through the upcoming LGND platform on Polygon.\nDespite the hype around digital fashion in Web3, which includes drops from historic fashion houses and myriad startups alike, NFT apparel has yet to drive significant mainstream interest at this early stage in the development of the metaverse.\nAD\nAD\nHowever, there’s already precedent for the popularity of digital wearables in Web2 games.

On Thursday, the latest example—from Solana NFT project Infinity Labs—will see a collection of NFTs from numerous Web3 projects breamed into orbit via the International Space Station.\nIn an exclusive interview with Decrypt, Infinity Eve—the pseudonymous founder of Infinity Labs—said that one of her inspirations for sending NFTs to space was the 1977 Voyager Mission, which included a \"Golden Record\" inscribed with music from around the world, including Chuck Berry, Mozart, Bach, and Louis Armstrong.\nAD\nAD\nThe idea for Dreambound Orbital came to her during the pandemic, when she says that she was in the hospital for treatment for an aggressive form of cancer.\n\"I didn't want to look at statistics [during treatment] because it was the worst thing I could do,\" Eve told Decrypt. \"And I was obsessed with this idea that if I could put art and stories onto the blockchain, I could build something really beautiful that could outlive me in some ways if anything were to happen to me.\"\nDreambound Orbital, a company that \"launches blockchain experiments into orbit,\" is the result. In researching how to send NFTs to space, Eve says she emailed several people who work in the space industry and eventually connected with NASA and visited its Space Center in Houston, Texas.\nDesigned by Nanoracks, The Bishop Airlock is an addition to the International Space Station (ISS) infrastructure that enables commercial utilization of the ISS. \"Now we were able to just make it happen,\" Eve said.\nAnd for the first mission, DreamboundM1, she's brought along a load of prominent Web3 allies. Joining Infinity Labs' NFT in its mission to the International Space Station are NFT assets contributed by the Solana Foundation, Metaplex, Phantom, Brave, Magic Eden, OpenSea, World of Women, MonkeDAO, Fractal, DeGods, Randi Zuckerberg, and more.\n\"I thought to myself: What is it about space that really inspires people, or just brings people together in so many ways,” she said, “and then also inspires people to think beyond themselves, or just feel like they're a part of something bigger?\"\nThe NFTs included in the payload include artwork previously auctioned by marketplace Magic Eden called \"This is Solana,\" created by pseudonymous artists TEJ and Ekko. It references many popular projects on the platform.\nAD\nAD\nNFTS ARE GOING TO THE MOON 🚀🌙... literally Couple of months ago, we did an auction called \"This is Solana\", created by @Tejji90 @MoonEkko33 ft some top collections. Today, the @dreamboundio x @InfinityLabsNFT crew sent it to outer space! ☄️🌌 pic.twitter.com/YAgZpfNwg7 — Magic Eden 🪄 (@MagicEden) December 15, 2022\nOther NFTs on the mission include Metaplex's Solana NFT standard whitepaper (tokenized itself as an NFT), a World of Women Galaxy profile picture, and the first Solana NFT minted by crypto-friendly web browser Brave. Holders of Infinity Labs' NFTs could also send their name or one of a loved one as part of the payload.\nWhile Dreambound is the latest outfit to send digital art to space, it’s not the first. In August 2021, a pair of NFTs were sent to the ISS via the Bishop Airlock, including Aku artwork from former baseball player turned digital artist, Micah Johnson. Last September's Inspiration4 private spaceflight via SpaceX also included NFTs, including music from the band Kings of Leon.\nAlthough Infinity Labs is a Solana NFT project, the digital payload going to space spans both Solana and Ethereum NFTs. The NFT files were uploaded to a server on the ISS today, where they will complete a rotation around the Earth before being \"beamed into neighboring systems,\" said Eve.\nOne of Dreambound's primary aims with sending the NFTs to the ISS, she explained, is to beam the images into deep space like the Voyager satellite before it, and perhaps someday enable a digital space economy and orbital NFT museum.\nSome might find the idea of NFTs being sent to the International Space Station a silly or unnecessary idea. To such criticism, Eve said to keep an open mind—you never know where inspiration can come from. Many critical technologies of today were enabled via experiments in space, like GPS.\n\"It starts with something that seems stupid or crazy; that stuff evolves over time,\" she said. \"The potential use case is being able to generate validated flight certificates of assets that went to the ISS, or have interacted with space in some way.\"\nOutside of Web3 applications, Eve believes there could be useful commercial applications and research for such an initiative, adding that life often imitates art and science fiction. Sci-fi inspired many of the technologies we use today, including smartphones. How might Web3 technology do the same?\n\"The line that we have on Orbital is, 'Despite everything, humanity found time to dream,'\" Eve said. \"Since Web3 meant a lot to me, it allowed me to reinvent myself and heal. I wanted to put [this] together for the Web3 community.\"\nAD\nAD"}, {"date": "2022-12-15 20:12:53", "entity": ["defi", "truefi", "maple"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "The news comes at a precarious time, with undercollateralized lending protocols grappling with loan defaults across the board.

But amid a significant decline in trading action on the platform and following recent layoffs from creator Dapper Labs, the blockchain’s native coin just set a new all-time low.\nFlow, the network’s eponymous native cryptocurrency, fell to $0.89 early this morning, marking a new low according to data tracked by CoinGecko. It has rebounded slightly to above $0.90, but Flow is still down 6% on the day, nearly 14% over the past week, and about 26% in 30 days.\nAD\nAD\nThat’s a marked contrast to the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap, Bitcoin and Ethereum, which have each posted gains in recent weeks. Bitcoin is up nearly 5% in the last month, while Ethereum has risen about 3% during the same span.\nOverall, Flow has fallen 98% in price since peaking above $42 per coin in April 2021, just as the initial NBA Top Shot hype cycle was starting to fade. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum are down about 75% from their respective all-time highs.\nFlow’s accelerated decline recently comes amid collapsing NFT trading volume on the network, with sharp month-over-month drops in network trading and declining activity on Dapper’s flagship platforms NBA Top Shot and NFL All Day.\nAccording to data from DappRadar, NFT trading volume on the Flow blockchain fell from nearly $39 million in September to about $15.6 million in October, and then again to about $7.7 million in November. Trading so far in December is trending below last month’s figure.\nA closer look at individual projects echoes the recent declines, with NBA Top Shot notching its worst month in nearly two years with under $2.1 million worth of marketplace trading in November, per CryptoSlam. That’s down from about $2.7 million in October, $4.7 million in September, and $7 million in August. Transaction and unique buyer counts have fallen as well.\nNBA Top Shot had its heyday in early 2021, as the platform was inundated with users when NFTs first found a broad audience outside of the crypto world. Top Shot notched $224 million worth of trading volume in February 2021 and nearly as much the following month, but prices fell sharply soon after as the initial NFT buzz died down.\nNFL All Day, Flow’s more recent sports NFT platform, has seen similar declines in recent months. It notched a record $14.3 million in trading volume in September, but then fell to nearly $6.7 million in October and $3.6 million in November. According to CryptoSlam, All Day has only amassed about $769,000 in marketplace trades so far in December.\nDapper Labs, the original creator of Flow and core contributor to the decentralized network, recently held significant layoffs amid the declining NFT market and so-called crypto winter. The firm announced a 22% reduction in staff in early November, although the number of impacted individuals was not revealed.\nAD\nAD\nWhile Flow’s NFT trading has declined more sharply than other popular networks like Ethereum and Solana in recent months, the broader NFT market has lost significant momentum since early this year.

Each step up the ladder provides greater benefits, the company said, including deeper discounts and access to NFT rewards.\nAD\nAD\nFor traders that have used multiple Solana wallets to trade NFTs on the platform, they can link all of them to a single Magic Eden account to maximize rewards considerations, rather than having each account based solely on a single wallet. A Magic Eden representative confirmed that wallet associations shared with the marketplace will be kept private and not disclosed publicly.\nMagic Eden said that rewards will include things like “loot boxes” from NFT projects, NFT giveaways, and discounts.. The program is described as a way for NFT creators to reach Magic Eden’s large user base, making it a marketing opportunity for projects while also potentially further entrenching the marketplace as the leader in the Solana space.\n“As a marketplace, we’ve been trying hard to ship innovation that goes beyond the pure transactional layer,” CEO Jack Lu said in a release. “Magic Eden Rewards gives us ways to celebrate and engage our community in new ways.”\nWhen your favorite marketplace is about to announce a rewards program 👀 pic.twitter.com/JzqWDuQIBA — Magic Eden 🪄 (@MagicEden) December 14, 2022\nThe rewards initiative also ties into an upcoming shift in the way that Magic Eden handles its own marketplace fees. Until recently, Magic Eden took a 2% cut from all secondary sales, although it temporarily waived its fee starting in mid-October when implementing the divisive decision to make creator royalty fees optional for traders.\nMagic Eden will continue to waive that platform fee through the end of 2022, and then in January, it will launch a new “dynamic maker/taker model” for platform fees. Essentially, the model will split fees between buyers and sellers, rather than have the firm take its cut solely from sellers.\nUnder this new model, the split will be determined in part by the loyalty rewards level of the users who log into an account, as well as the type of transaction in play. Listing NFTs and bidding on listed NFTs are considered “maker” transactions under this model, the company said, while buying an NFT or selling instantly via a collection offer is a “taker” transaction.\nMagic Eden told Decrypt that makers and takers alike can each receive up to 45% off the platform fee depending on their rewards loyalty level. However, the company has yet to fully announce details regarding the new fee structure.\nAD\nAD\nMagic Eden was valued at $1.6 billion in June when it raised a $130 million Series B round. It has dominated the Solana NFT space since launching in late 2021 and has expanded into Ethereum since, with support for Polygon—the Ethereum scaling network—up next.\nThe marketplace briefly lost significant market share this fall when rival marketplaces sprung up that didn’t require traders to pay creator royalty fees, typically a 5% to 10% cut of the sale price. However, Magic Eden reclaimed its market-leading share after following suit and making creator fees optional for users.\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication with additional details from Magic Eden."}, {"date": "2022-12-14 19:55:50", "entity": ["ftx"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "Brown and other lawmakers in the hearing settled into the lanes the parties have established in the wake of FTX: condemnation and suspicion of cryptocurrencies from Democrats, and an insistence from Republicans that the technology isn't to blame.

FinCEN proposed such a rule in December 2020, which many crypto industry companies and advocates spoke out against, but it has yet to be implemented. The bill seeks to finalize that process.\nFurthermore, the bill prohibits any financial institution from using a digital asset mixer service or other privacy-enhancing technologies. Mixers are typically used to conceal transactions of cryptocurrency between wallets. The best-known Ethereum mixer service, Tornado Cash, was banned by the U.S. Treasury via sanctions in August.\n“The crypto industry should follow common-sense rules like banks, brokers, and Western Union, and this legislation would ensure the same standards apply across similar financial transactions,” said Warren in a statement. “The bipartisan bill will help close crypto money laundering loopholes and strengthen enforcement to better safeguard U.S. national security.”\nAlready, the proposed bill has drawn significant scrutiny from the crypto industry. In a post this morning, crypto advocacy group Coin Center decried the bill as “an opportunistic, unconstitutional assault on cryptocurrency self custody, developers, and node operators.”\nSenators Warren and Marshall's proposed bill subjecting software devs & nodes to AML is \"a repudiation of liberal values and a move towards the types of surveillance and control prized by authoritarians like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and Kim Jong-un\"https://t.co/s7pRKsWV2W — Peter Van Valkenburgh 🌐🌮 (@valkenburgh) December 14, 2022\n“The Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act is a direct attack on technological progress and also a direct attack on our personal privacy and autonomy,” wrote Coin Center Director of Research, Peter Van Valkenburgh.\n“Make no mistake, while proposed as a solution to potential money laundering and terrorist financing, the bill is in fact a repudiation of liberal values and a move towards the types of surveillance and control prized by authoritarians like Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, and Kim Jong-un,” he added.\nAD\nAD\nThe bill was introduced following November’s collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX, with founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried arrested this week by Bahamian police amid numerous criminal charges from U.S. authorities.\nBankman-Fried faces charges from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), as well as the Complex Frauds and Cybercrime Unit at the Southern District of New York U.S. Attorney’s Office. Coin Center alleges that the bill would not prevent another FTX-like collapse in the future.\n“This bill is focused exclusively on financial surveillance and does not address any of the issues of corporate control that led to the collapse of FTX,” Van Valkenburgh wrote.\nThe proposed bill has drawn similar scrutiny as last year’s infrastructure bill, which changed the Internal Revenue Service’s definition of a “broker” to include companies that trade crypto assets, forcing exchanges to report transactions to the government. That bill was feared to also impact network participants like validators and miners, plus crypto wallet providers and more.\nRegulation focused on unhosted wallets has also gained traction in Europe this year, with the European Union voting to impose KYC on such wallets in March, and the United Kingdom considering similar legislation this summer before ultimately scrapping its plans."}, {"date": "2022-12-14 15:51:07", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "He could get off easier if he is offered and chooses to accept a plea deal from prosecutors, but even such a deal would almost certainly involve many years of prison time.

But a new report suggests that Apple is planning to open up its ecosystem—a move that may benefit apps built around NFTs and possibly expand the ability to make mobile crypto payments.\nBloomberg reports that Apple plans to enable the installation of apps from external sources outside of its own App Store on iPhones and iPads, according to sources familiar with the plans. The changes are being made in response to the European Union’s Digital Markets Act, which requires tech companies to fully comply with restrictions by 2024.\nAD\nAD\nAccording to the report, the rollout of support for external apps from third-party sources and marketplaces will initially begin only in Europe to comply with the new law. However, the functionality could be expanded to other territories depending on whether those countries adopt similar regulations.\nApple is reportedly aiming to launch the feature in its iOS 17 software update, which is expected to launch next fall based on the typical annual release schedule.\nThe company is still weighing whether to allow third-party apps to use their own payments infrastructure, Bloomberg claims, rather than force developers to route payments through Apple’s own payments setup. That particular shift, if implemented, could make it much easier to spend cryptocurrency through iPhone and iPad apps.\nThe reported changes come amid growing pushback to Apple’s closed ecosystem, which not only philosophically clashes with Web3’s decentralized ethos but also has led to restrictions around the ways that apps can utilize NFT assets. In October, Apple updated its developer guidelines to state that NFTs cannot be used to gate access to features or content within apps.\nNFT purchases are also subject to Apple’s 30% fee—a potentially impossible limitation to enforce on secondary market sales, at least. The iOS apps for marketplaces like OpenSea and Magic Eden only allow users to browse NFTs, not buy or sell them through the app.\nApple’s NFT rule changes have caused havoc with existing iOS apps as well. Coinbase recently announced that it had to disable NFT transfers through its mobile Wallet app, as Apple said that users would have to pay 30% of any network gas fee (like on Ethereum) for the action. Coinbase described that demand as “not possible” to implement.\nDan Finlay, co-founder of popular crypto wallet app MetaMask and a former Apple employee, tweeted in support of Coinbase, calling out Apple’s “abuse of monopoly.” He suggested that MetaMask could be next to be impacted by Apple’s rules, and added, “I'll absolutely stand in solidarity here.”\nApple’s reported upcoming plans to open up its ecosystem could benefit NFT and crypto apps that are currently limited or hobbled by App Store requirements. Such apps could then be installed via external sources and not be reliant on Apple’s strict policies, although Bloomberg reports that Apple may institute additional “security requirements” for outside apps.\nAD\nAD\nThe move could also benefit the growing Web3 metaverse, as Apple is widely reported to be developing a mixed reality headset that may debut sometime in 2023. Many Web3 developers are building towards a metaverse defined by interoperability between platforms, using NFTs to represent ownership of assets that can be freely used across spaces.\nWeb3 developers aren’t alone in griping about Apple’s current model. Epic Games sued Apple—as well as Google with its Android Play Store—after the tech giant blocked its popular Fortnite game over the addition of a third-party payments model.\nA previous court decision that could have forced Apple to allow third-party payments was ultimately delayed, and the companies are still embroiled in the legal battle. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney tweeted about today's report, pressing lawmakers to pass similar legislation to potentially force Apple to open up its ecosystem in the United States as well.\nMark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg, says Apple is preparing to open iOS to competing app stores - but only in Europe. This would leave American developers in serfdom in the nation where Apple was founded. Congress must pass the Open Apps Market Act! https://t.co/GnCChgi0hX — Possibly Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) December 13, 2022\nIf external apps are only allowed in Europe, it \"would leave American developers in serfdom in the nation where Apple was founded,\" Sweeney tweeted. \"Congress must pass the Open Apps Market Act!\"\nNew Twitter owner Elon Musk also recently complained about Apple’s policies, and tweeted asking if Apple “[hates] free speech” after the firm cut its ad spending on the social media platform. Musk also alleged that Apple was considering removing the Twitter app, but later chalked it up to a “misunderstanding” after meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook."}, {"date": "2022-12-13 21:56:56", "entity": ["roberts"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "His lawyer, Jerome Roberts, argued that Bankman-Fried was not a flight risk, citing his ownership of real estate in the Bahamas, as well as the fact that he had been in possession of his passport for at least three weeks before his arrest on Monday, and could have left the country at any time (Roberts told the court on Tuesday that \"when it became clear that local police had no interest in Mr. Bankman-Fried, they released his passport to me\").

While SEC Chair Gary Gensler has made very clear that he views most crypto assets as securities in need of SEC registration, and has painted the industry as a Wild West, Peirce, one of five commissioners at the U.S. banking regulator, has long been openly pro-crypto, though in her framing, \"I'm more pro the ability of people to try things and experiment with things, and I think there's been a lot of interesting experimentation in the crypto space, and I expect there'll be a lot more in coming years.\"\nPeirce spoke to Decrypt last week for the latest episode of the gm podcast. She prefaced her comments, as she always does, by saying they are her own, and do not represent the views of the SEC. Peirce was initially nominated to serve as an SEC commissioner by President Barack Obama in 2016, but the Senate did not act on her nomination until 2017. She’s currently serving a 5-year term, which is set to expire in 2025. \"Because I've been at the SEC since 2018, to see no real movement—positive movement—in that time, is frustrating.\"\nShe said she first heard about Bitcoin around 2012 and has been learning about the broader crypto ecosystem ever since. But her interests are broader than that, she said, adding that her optimism around the industry has more to do with her desire to change the SEC’s approach to innovative new financial products—crypto and otherwise.\n“It’s wanting to keep the doors open to innovation, wanting to make sure that the financial industry is not one that’s dominated by a few large firms that keeps everyone else out. Because there are a lot of people with great ideas and I think it’s great that people are challenging the way we’ve done things,” she said.\nThe FTX effect\nAt the time of Peirce's interview last week, former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried hadn’t yet been arrested in The Bahamas and the SEC hadn’t yet charged him for allegedly defrauding equity investors in the company. Since Monday night, the Department of Justice has also levied charges, alleging he committed conspiracy, wire fraud, and money laundering, and the CFTC plans a lawsuit for commodities law violations.\nCracks in the foundation of FTX started to show in early November, when a report revealed that the crypto exchange's sister company, Alameda Research, held billions in illiquid FTT (the exchange token of FTX) on its balance sheet. A subsequent tweet from Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao referencing those \"revelations\" triggered massive withdrawals from FTX. After a few days, FTX had to freeze funds. The company sought a buyout first from Binance, but ultimately filed for bankruptcy on November 11.\nLast week, Peirce said she’d been telling people that everything Bankman-Fried came to represent is not, in her view, the extent of the crypto’s industry’s potential.\nAD\nAD\n“When I talk to people, I remind people, one: that crypto is not about centralized entities; two: that crypto is not about trading, either,\" Peirce said. \"Although there’s been a lot of emphasis on trading in the last several years, that is not the core of what crypto is. And if it is the core, it’s probably not living up to its potential. And three: it is still early days, so we do have more to see.”\nNow that Bankman-Fried has been arrested and charged by multiple entities, Peirce’s warning about regulatory frameworks born out of reactions to the FTX blowup is especially prescient. What she hopes not to see, she said, is another big legislative push that happens before thorough analysis has been done, like after the 2008 global financial crisis.\n“I think we should all be on the lookout for regulatory frameworks that are developed in the context of enforcement action, because it’s a very tempting thing for regulators to do that,” she said. “And it just cuts everybody else out of the process.”\nShe recalled that the 2008 recession was the catalyst for a lot of new regulations. The biggest and most sweeping measure was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which itself paved the way for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Financial Stability Oversight Council, and the Volcker Rule to curtail speculative investments.\nIt’s telling that the DOJ itself has compared the FTX collapse to Lehman Brothers. While Peirce said she has been vocal in not wanting to see a big wave of reactionary regulation, she recommends that companies in the crypto industry proceed with caution.\n\"I urge people: The reach of the securities laws is very broad,\" she said. \"If you have any doubt—even if you don’t have any doubt—it’s good to think about calling a lawyer.”\nListen and subscribe to the gm podcast wherever you get your podcasts."}, {"date": "2022-12-13 18:25:27", "entity": ["binance", "ftx", "nansen"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral"], "content": "Withdrawals from Binance, the world’s largest exchange by trading volume, surged Monday amid growing concerns about its reserves at a time when investors are extremely wary about centralized exchanges given the swift collapse of rival exchange FTX.

The parameter changes revolve primarily around the amount of debt different vaults can safely onboard.\nTwenty different \"recognized delegates\" within the ecosystem will also earn 103,230 DAI for their governance work.\nMakerDAO, the 'Endgame', and RWAs\nThe reason the protocol can afford to raise rates this much is thanks to new revenue generated from so-called real-world assets (RWAs).\nAD\nAD\nAs part of Rune Christensen’s, Maker’s founder, Endgame Plan, the protocol has made a hard push to create new money streams from some of its idle holdings. One such stream comes from RWAs, which are assets untied to the world of crypto.\nThe Endgame Plan is a three-part proposal to firm up MakerDAO against regulatory capture. First proposed as a response to authorities' blacklisting crypto mixer Tornado Cash, Christensen wants the protocol to generate as much money as possible via all means in order to convert to Ethereum.\nEthereum, unlike RWAs or Circle's USDC, is far more difficult to halt should authorities turn their gaze upon the crypto bank.\nFor example, the MakerDAO community voted to deploy 500 million DAI to buy up U.S. short-term Treasuries and bonds from BlackRock. The protocol is also generating revenue from a tie-up with Gemini and its native stablecoin called GUSD. In exchange for holding 100 million GUSD, Gemini will pay Maker 1.25% in annualized interest.\nAs for what's next, the MakerGrowth team pointed out the ratification of MIP-81, which will see the protocol deposit roughly $1.6 billion into Coinbase Institutional and earn 1.5% per year."}, {"date": "2022-12-13 13:59:02", "entity": ["department of justice", "monica", "ftx", "monica", "nasdaq", "nyse", "ftx", "defi", "anchorage digital", "m31 capital", "anchorage digital bank", "m31", "ethereum", "arweave", "cosmos", "helium", "m31", "ftx", "digital currency group", "anchorage", "comptroller of the currency", "anchorage digital bank"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Investment fund manager M31 Capital has chosen Anchorage Digital Bank to custody the $100 million Web3 Opportunity Fund it launched in October.\nFounded in 2020 by CEO Nathan Montone, M31 now has five different funds fueling the move towards decentralization and has already amassed many big names in its portfolio: Ethereum Name Service, Arweave, Cosmos, and Helium.\nAD\nAD\nAnchorage seemed like a natural choice because the bank allows its crypto custody clients to participate in the governance process that drives so many DeFi projects, although M31 chief operating officer Michael Swensson told Decrypt it’s a very demanding role to play.\n“We try to be actively involved with anything that we invest in. It's a very resource intensive strategy, but we think it's the right strategy,” he said. “Specifically because of where the space is and how early it is.”\nAccess to the DeFi governance process and opportunities to earn yield on deposits help, but in a post-FTX world, institutional crypto investors have a whole new barrage of questions for custodians, according to Diogo Monica, co-founder and president of Anchorage Digital.\n“I wind up saying we ended up winning a bigger portion of a smaller pie,” Monica told Decrypt on Monday. “It's a bigger portion because everybody is now coming to Anchorage because they want a bank.\n“They want trusted security. They want auditability. They want SOC1, SOC2,” he added, referring to Security Operations Center reports that are standard in traditional finance. “They want bankruptcy remote. Nobody a year ago talked about bankruptcy remote—now it's the first question that people ask.”\nFor a firm to be bankruptcy remote means that it’s organized within a corporate group so that any one of its business lines would be minimally impacted if another filed for bankruptcy.\nIt’s a very timely concern, given the more than 130 entities that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection along with FTX in November and the lingering questions about whether parent company Digital Currency Group could survive if its trading desk, Genesis, isn’t able to come up with the $900 million it owes clients.\nAnchorage, founded in 2017, got its Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charter for Anchorage Digital Bank in early 2021. That makes it the first and, as of this writing, only federally-chartered crypto bank in the U.S.. That distinction has made it the bank of choice for the Department of Justice, which chose Anchorage to custody seized crypto assets.\nAD\nAD\nFrom what Monica has seen, the collapse of FTX last month triggered an institutional investor flight to safety—but not back into U.S. dollars. Rather, there’s been an influx of clients at standalone crypto custodians that safeguard assets and a client’s private keys.\nHe said he’s long criticized exchanges acting as custodians, but added it’s been hard to get people to pay attention since it can be seen as a self-serving comment.\n“We've been telling everyone, ‘Look, the reason why we're a custodian that only serves institutions is because we don't want conflicts of interest,’” Monica said. “Specifically, we've always said to everyone that cares to listen that exchanges doing custody is wrong. It is wrong in the traditional world. The Nasdaq does not do custody. NYSE it didn't do custody. It's other custodians that do it. It's wrong because there's no multi-party integrity.”\nMulti-party integrity means that two different firms could check their ledgers to confirm that a client's funds are where they’re supposed to be and that the client has as much money as they say they do.\n“This is just a basic primitive that was created in the traditional world to make sure that there’s no issues like at FTX, where the ledgers are mislabeled or whatever it is,” Monica said. “That is just a strong foundation for a good market structure that we’ve never had in crypto because exchanges came out of nowhere and do everything: Yield generation, staking.\n“They do it for institutions, they do it for retail. They trade, they do custody, they settle,” he added. “They do everything, which are all different entities in the traditional world.”"}, {"date": "2022-12-13 13:37:53", "entity": ["bitcoin", "ether", "##um coindesk market index"], "sentiment": ["Positive", "Positive", "Positive"], "content": "Bitcoin (BTC), the largest cryptocurrency by market value, which has been relatively steady so far in December, jumped 1.6% in the minutes after the report was released, to about $17,930; it's up 5.2% over the past 24 hours.

Those commonalities led to MNTGE (pronounced “Mintage”), a digital fashion startup that seeks to bridge the gap between vintage wear and the metaverse.\nMNTGE was founded by Nick Adler—entrepreneur and Snoop Dogg’s brand manager—along with sneaker designer and streetwear store owner Sean Wotherspoon and former Adidas marketing manager Brennan Russo. Adler told Decrypt that he and Russo had the “aha moment” behind MNTGE while visiting Wotherspoon’s shop, Round Two.\nAD\nAD\n“We just started to kind of really geek out over it,” said Adler of the parallels and potential mash-up between NFTs and vintage apparel.\nA MNTGE digital wearable scanned from a physical jacket. Image: MNTGE\nLaunching on Wednesday with an Ethereum NFT dubbed the MNTGE Pass, the firm aims to bring physical vintage fashion to the NFT world as digital wearables that can be used in metaverse platforms. But it also seeks to build a community amongst fashion and streetwear aficionados, providing priority access to real vintage finds.\nMNTGE’s plans after launching the MNTGE Pass are varied, but they start with a drop of digital fashion curated by Wotherspoon himself in Q1 2023. The drop will showcase the kind of technology that the startup is playing with, using a high-end capture system—the same used to create digital doubles of actors for movies—to perfectly recreate physical vintage apparel.\nAdler showed a video demo of the above jacket, which was stitched together via imagery captured by the rig and turned into a stitch-accurate digital wearable. It’s based on a real 1960s denim jacket that Wotherspoon won at auction, and Adler said that his co-founder wanted to be able to see the stitching on the scanned digital recreation.\nDrop a 🌊 if you’re hype for our first drop with @seanwotherspoon !

Adler said that the startup has obtained “broad licenses” from as-yet-unannounced brands to bring their vintage fashion into the metaverse, but that it will first establish itself through pieces that aren’t tied to licenses.\nEach of the 1,500 MNTGE Pass Day One NFTs will sell for 0.5 ETH (about $640) and grant holders access to MNTGE’s token-gated Discord community, plus priority access to Wotherspoon’s drop and more ahead from other designers. There will also be NFTs airdropped to holders along the way—bonus “Easter eggs,” Adler said.\nAD\nAD\nBeyond the digital drops, MNTGE is working on ways to offer holders access to the kind of vintage gems that Wotherspoon and his allies regularly source. Pass holders will be able to shop at the future MNTGE Market online store to purchase authenticated vintage apparel, which Adler said will be sold without the typically sizable markups seen at trendy shops.\nMNTGE co-founders Adler, Wotherspoon, and Russo (from left), plus founding advisor Clarke Miyasaki. Image: MNTGE\nMNTGE also aims to host future physical pop-up shops around art and fashion world events, such as Art Basel or New York Fashion Week, providing further benefits for holders. The firm is also working with popular NFT profile picture (PFP) projects, Adler said, to develop potential future collaborations around digital apparel.\nAlong with aiding Snoop in his many NFT endeavors, Adler has served as an advisor for an array of Web3 projects, including the Bored Ape Yacht Club and The Sandbox. He’s now creating for the metaverse at a time in which NFT land plots and avatars no longer command the kind of towering sums and fervent demand seen this time last year.\n“No pun intended—the land grab is over,” said Adler.\nInstead, with MNTGE, he said he wanted to build something original from scratch that he believes will endure through the bear market. As hardware like VR headsets and AR glasses become more approachable and accessible in the future, Adler believes that digital apparel will be well poised to take off as an NFT-powered Web3 metaverse expands.\n“Some of the hype has died, and you're gonna see a lot of losers from the metaverse craze,” he said. “But there will be a handful that sustain and will come out as big winners.

The Knights Who Say Nah is a pioneering NFT project, billing itself as a “multi-platform media company.” Its aim is to combine narrative storytelling, profile pictures (PFPs), a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and real historical artifacts to create a new model for history and heritage.\nOver several weeks, The Knights Who Say Nah will release PFPs based on ancient warriors and 3D renderings of arms and armor scanned using photogrammetry. Its mission is to digitize, collect and curate historical arms and armor—all governed through a DAO that will control the project’s treasury.\nAt its heart is a collection of NFTs that represent historical artifacts drawn from a private collection housing more than 6,000 artifacts from 50 cultures, representing 6,000 years of history. Nick Richey, ‘Keeper of Arms’ of the collection, wanted to find a creative way to share these pieces with the public.\nDespite their outstanding aesthetics and historical value, arms and armor have no spotlight on them, Richey explained. “When you go to a museum, the arms and armor department's probably one of the last places you go,” he told Decrypt.\nBut that relative indifference is at odds with their cultural impact. They’re seen on screen in films such as “The Northman” and “The Last Duel”; in TV shows like “Vikings”; and even in video games like “Assassin’s Creed.” Their influence is felt in the fantasy shows that currently dominate pop culture, like “House of the Dragon” and “The Rings of Power.”\n8 ancient cultures\n1111 Knights in each\nMinting begins end of summer ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/KBF3qMW05q — Knights Who Say Nah (@KnightsSayNah) August 16, 2022\nIn a way, Richey said, arms and armor are like IRL NFTs; they have traits of varying rarity, they’re unique, and they carry a wealth of history and narrative.\n“Not only are there treasures underneath these objects, but then it also starts to unravel the story. You’re starting to pull the string and then you start to look into—well, why was this design on this sword?,” Richey said. “You just start to dig in and you start to learn about these people and how we're connected to them.”\nThe Knights Who Say Nah wants to explore those hidden narratives masterfully crafted hundreds or thousands of years ago and bring them to our generation while ensuring their permanence for future generations. Here’s how they’re planning to go about it.\nNarrative-driven drops\nThe Knights Who Say Nah will kick off with an initial drop of 1,111 generative PFPs. Each drop represents different groups of ancient warriors; the first culture to be released is the ancient samurai of Japan.\nPFP drops will be followed by a series of NFTs of 3D artifacts pertaining to that culture. That means in the week following the samurai PFP release, you can expect to see NFTs of real samurai swords like katana and tanto, hundreds—and in some cases thousands—of years old..\nStep 1 in the photogrammetry process is to have our photographers take pictures 360 degrees around the model In this case we had to manually turn the pedestal 100 times per angle to capture the samurai armor. We ended up with over 300 photos! pic.twitter.com/5DlilwW0dz — Knights Who Say Nah (@KnightsSayNah) October 3, 2022\nThose objects are scanned using a painstaking process known as photogrammetry, in which hundreds of photos are taken of the object from various angles and in exacting light conditions. The photos are then layered over a 3D mesh that’s tweaked to match the dimensions of the real object, and tweaked so that the lighting is consistent across the whole object. “It’s like a 12-step process that takes up to 40 hours per object,” said Richey, adding that in future, NFT holders could be able to 3D print a copy of the object.\n3D photogrammetry is used to scan the artifacts.

An experienced screenwriter, he’s currently creating elaborate scripts and character arcs for the ancient warriors depicted throughout the project—all of whom are based on real historical figures, like like Tomoe Gozen, a female samurai from the late Heian period of Japanese history.\n“We’ll release those to our community so they can read them episode by episode,” he said, adding that he’s also pitching the project to various TV and animation studios. “Ideally, I'm going to go to the Adult Swim world and try to find a partner. If Knights doesn’t find a partner, there's also the Web3 space,” he added, pointing to the example of NFT series like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis’ Stoner Cats.\nThe heritage DAO\nKnights Who Say Nah isn’t just about presenting a collection in a new way; it’s also aiming to evolve into a heritage DAO, in which Knights NFT holders will vote on how to curate the digital collection, and even what new pieces to acquire on the open market.\nOnce the DAO acquires pieces, Richey has an ambitious plan in mind: 3D-scan the physical artifacts and then donate these physical artifacts to the communities from which they originate. With museums around the world grappling with their colonial legacies and the various claims on the artifacts in their collections, it’s a novel approach.\nThis is one of the reasons the Knights exist! To create new ways for people to appreciate cultural artifacts, and help museums use this technology to do so as well! https://t.co/SPyFZGRoMu — Knights Who Say Nah (@KnightsSayNah) October 1, 2022\nMuseums could, he suggested, hold 3D printed versions of the artifacts while the objects themselves are returned to the tribes or nations from which they originated. They could even form revenue streams, with objects being licensed to video games or metaverse platforms. “It's not just about you making money, it's about the project having a treasury so that we can give back to these cultures,” Richey explained.\nAn ambitious plan, of course, but Richey is ambitious. And he knows that Web3 is a bold experimental space.\n“Imagine being someone in our community that owns this gothic warhammer NFT,” he said. “You get to go to the Metropolitan Museum and you can see it's been donated by the Knights Who Say Nah and you're holding your AR version in front of the real thing.

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt.\nThis week’s crypto market was another mixed bag as the industry continues to navigate the continued contagion from the FTX collapse.\nAD\nAD\nBitcoin and Ethereum again closed the week basically flat, which might be considered a win considering the losses some of the other top coins experience. As of Saturday morning, Bitcoin (BTC) was up less than 1% over the past seven days, and Ethereum (ETH) was down 1.5%. Most of the top 50 coins by market cap were in the red for the past week or, if in the green, up less than 2%.\nBTC fluctuated between roughly $17,300 and as low as $16,700, while Ethereum jumped between $1,300 and $1,225 as bears and bulls fought for control.\nBut a rare winner over the past seven days was Axie Infinity’s native AXS token. The token rose by a whopping 21% since last weekend and is now trading hands at roughly $8.50, per CoinGecko.\nThe AXS token is used in the popular play-to-earn crypto game, where users battle Pokémon-like creatures.\nAXS is the project’s governance token, allowing holders to vote on things like how the project’s treasury should be allocated, or proposed new features in the game. The game uses another token called the Smooth Love Potion (SLP), which is used as a reward for users for winning duels.\nThis week’s spike follows the launch of the project’s Axie Contributors initiative. Roughly 700 “committed” members of the community will earn formal roles within the game’s governance model as part of Axie’s push for more informed discussions about how the game should operate.\nAfter AXS, the native token powering the self-custody crypto wallet Trust Wallet is also on a rally. TWT has risen roughly 6% over the past seven days, nearly hitting $3, per CoinGecko. Like Axie Infinity’s token, Trust Wallet is a governance token used to vote on new development for the Binance-owned wallet.\nTokens for the decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch (1INCH), Chainlink (LINK), and Flow (FLOW), all round out this week’s biggest losers.\nFTX contagion continues\nThe collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire last month is still causing damage in the industry, with several firms announcing more layoffs this week in the wake of FTX's bankruptcy.\nAD\nAD\nBybit, Swytfx, and Koinly all announced a cut in their workforce, citing both contagion from the collapse of FTX and the ongoing bear market.\nBesides layoffs, Maple Finance, a platform that lets firms spin up a lending facility using smart contracts, was also hit with knock-on effects. The platform announced this week that it would be cutting all ties with Orthogonal Trading after the latter “misrepresented” its exposure to FTX, leading it to default on its loans.\nM11 Credit, the firm that created the lending facility on Maple from which Orthogonal borrowed, said, \"we believe that Orthogonal Trading previously purposefully misstated their exposure and has therefore committed a serious breach of the Master Loan Agreement (MLA).\"\nIt wasn’t just M11 and Maple that got burned.

(art: Grant Kempster)\nSushiSwap, the popular decentralized exchange, made a tough call this week as it navigates the ongoing bear market.\nAD\nAD\nOn December 5, project lead Jared Grey proposed that all staking fees on the platform be redirected to the project’s treasury for a year. He added that a new tokeonomics model for the project is also “on the horizon,” suggesting quite a shake-up for SushiSwap.\nCurrently, users that stake their SUSHI—the project’s native governance token—get the xSUSHI token in return and also trading fees on the platform for doing so. Grey’s proposal would put an end to that, with those trading fees being redirected to the project’s treasury.\nFees on the platform, by the way, amount to 0.3% of each trade, with 0.25% given to the liquidity provider sustaining the pool and the remaining 0.5% going to those SUSHI stakers. If passed, this proposal would divert that 0.5% back to SushiSwap’s coffers.\nThe reason behind the move? Shore up the project’s treasury in these tumultuous times.\nGrey said that SushiSwap currently has roughly 18 months of runway, and that this proposal is a means to “secure the future of Sushi by acting in its best interests together.”\nSo far, the vote indicates that the majority of voters approve.\nSource: SushiSwap\nBut there is also some vocal pushback. After all, stakers are going to lose a cut of those funds if passed. “Depriving xSushi holders of the fees they are entitled to is a breach of primary covenant before the community,” wrote one user.\nAlongside the heated debate, it also appears these stakers are un-staking their funds pretty dramatically. Data pulled from Dune reveals a marked drop off in the amount of SUSHI being staked at roughly the same time that Grey made this proposal. Others have pointed to the Sushi team’s current salaries, too, which allegedly amount to over $3.8 million per year. “So, I was right,” wrote another user. “You just want to cover your salaries.”\nAmount of SUSHI in staking contract.

It also names MoonPay, the crypto payments startup that allegedly facilitated those endorsements.\nAD\nAD\nThough the suit lists 10 charges ranging from violations of California’s consumer protection laws to violations of federal securities laws, its 100-page filing tells, more or less, a single story.\nIt details an elaborate alleged conspiracy, engineered by Hollywood’s elite, to boost the value of Bored Apes with a torrent of celebrity promotions—all while secretly enriching all involved via a covert payments scheme laundered through a prominent crypto company.\nThe suit alleges that talent manager Guy Oseary—Madonna’s longtime representative, as well as Yuga’s—instructed his extensive celebrity network to publicly support Yuga’s products, including Bored Ape NFTs, in exchange for payments from Yuga secretly funneled through MoonPay. Oseary, also named as a co-defendant in the suit, was an early investor in MoonPay.\nMoonPay, now valued at $3.4 billion, counts many of the suit’s celebrity defendants among its investors, including Bieber, Curry, Hilton, Kevin Hart, Jimmy Fallon, and Gwyneth Paltrow. The firm gained prominence in 2021 by offering a white-glove service that facilitated purchasing high-value NFTs for celebrity clients.\nThursday’s suit argues that MoonPay was instead a “front operation,” which secretly passed payments from Yuga Labs—the $4 billion company behind the Bored Ape Yacht Club—to celebrities who went on to promote the NFTs without disclosing their enrichment, at Oseary’s direction.\nYuga Labs, for its part, vigorously denies the allegations.\n“In our view, these claims are opportunistic and parasitic,” a company spokesperson told Decrypt. “We strongly believe that they are without merit, and look forward to proving as much.”\nThe suit comes courtesy of law firm Scott+Scott, which in July announced another potential class-action suit against Yuga. That firm claimed then that Yuga Labs violated securities laws in its sale and promotion of Bored Ape NFTs and ApeCoin, the Bored Ape ecosystem’s Ethereum-based token, and sought plaintiffs for a potential lawsuit.\nAD\nAD\nThe law firm did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTo succeed in the suit, the plaintiff’s attorneys will have to prove that Yuga’s cadre of celebrity amplifiers engaged in unfair or deceptive practices when they endorsed the company’s products. Receiving secret payouts through an elaborate cover-up operation would almost certainly fulfill that standard; whether such a scheme can be proven, however, is another matter.\nEchoing the firm's previous suit, the complaint also alleges that Bored Ape NFTs are unregistered securities. If proven, that allegation would further raise the bar for disclosure information.\nWhile American courts have not yet ruled that so-called \"blue chip\" profile picture (PFP) NFT collections like the Bored Ape Yacht Club constitute securities, an October report revealed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating Yuga Labs over potential securities violations.\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to clarify the status of Scott+Scott's previous actions."}, {"date": "2022-12-09 22:51:50", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "The vice president had recently indicated she’d be holding the pen on the Parliament’s effort to clear up ambiguities in the rules for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and she said she wanted to avoid the controversies of the EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets law (MiCA) by focusing on regulating activities rather than individual entities."}, {"date": "2022-12-09 22:30:21", "entity": ["block", "block", "block", "sbf", "ftx", "alameda research"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Block’s CEO, Michael McCaffrey, immediately resigned after the loans came to light.

Although it hasn’t taken any formal action in response to FTX’s bankruptcy, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has been paying attention.\nOn Thursday, the SEC published new guidelines urging companies to provide more details on their cryptocurrency holdings.\nThe guidelines, which include a sample letter on the regulator’s website, say that firms should disclose third-party crypto market participants, risks to the company’s liquidity, access to financing, and potential impact of any “legal proceedings, investigations, or regulatory” matters.\nThe guidance also specifically called out flagging the “downstream effect” of bankruptcy of third-party companies could impact firms themselves.\nEarlier in the week, crypto insurance protocol Nexus Mutual disclosed a $3 million Ethereum exposure to Orthogonal Trading, another knock-on effect from FTX’s collapse. On Monday, crypto exchanges Bybit and Swytftx announced they were reducing their headcount as the crypto bear market intensified following the FTX’s downfall.\nAD\nAD"}, {"date": "2022-12-09 20:53:22", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "The FET token’s price has jumped from 6 cents at the start of the week to now 11 cents, surging 80% in the five days since Sunday and 30% in the past 24 hours alone."}, {"date": "2022-12-09 20:43:15", "entity": ["math money fx", "bitcoin", "stock exchange", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Originally named Math Money FX, the company was formed in 2013 to help financial institutions leverage the Bitcoin blockchain to \"reduce risk, save costs, and increase efficiencies,\" according to a company timeline.

These stamps, which reflect the history of the 51-year-old coffee juggernaut, can be collected and eventually traded. An NFT is a blockchain token that represents ownership in a unique asset, including digital goods like artwork and collectibles.\nThe stamps and points also collectively unlock access to potential exclusive experiences, such as online drink-making classes, events at Starbucks’ flagship Reserve Roastery locations, or even a trip to the company’s coffee farm in Costa Rica.\nIn 2023, Starbucks Odyssey will launch its NFT marketplace powered by Nifty Gateway, letting users buy and sell their Journey Stamps, as well as purchase limited-edition NFTs created in collaboration with company partners.

Bitcoin was created in 2009, 13 years ago.\nZhao acknowledged that Krugman made a good point but noted that the thing we now know as the internet was developed in the 1960s with the US Advanced Research Projects Agency Network or ARPANET, followed by the US military's use of email in the 1980s.\n\"The issue seems to be with governments and regulations rather than the technology,\" Krugman responded, noting that he’d become a believer in crypto if it could get him through immigration faster when he travels to Europe. Pointing to the ease with which travelers using Global Entry can enter the United States, he added, \"The trouble is they're not transferable, and blockchain won't help.\"\nMany crypto enthusiasts point to the 2008 financial crisis as why Bitcoin and the industry it birthed are necessary. But many have questioned how practical it is to expect the average person to understand the technology and its financial implications.\n\"What is interesting is, after 2008 and all of those disasters, and we responded not with education, we responded with regulation, we responded with Dodd-Frank, with stuff that basically tried to bring more of the financial system under the umbrella of prudential regulations,\" Krugman said.\n\"Wouldn't the lesson from all of that be not to expect high school students to come out able to understand all of that stuff that you're telling me about?\" he asked.\n\"It's not black and white,\" Zhao responded. \"I think, from a regulatory perspective, it is important for regulations to continue to evolve with new technologies, new industries, to protect consumers, I think that is needed.”\nZhao added that at the same time, people need to learn how to protect themselves.\n\"No solution is perfect. I'm not saying that education will solve all problems, [but it would] improve a little bit,\" Zhao said.\nAD\nAD\nKrugman said there will be a gradual expansion of the regulatory net, adding that he believes that most crypto is used for regulatory evasion and avoidance.

Prince went on to found B+J Studios, which raised $10 million in September to develop NFT infrastructure.\n“Metaplex was built to elevate creators and artists above traditional gatekeepers, but those same commercial dynamics have re-emerged within Solana NFTs and are trying to pressure us into a half-baked governance scheme to take the standard out of the community’s hands,” the startup wrote.\n2/ Metaplex was built to elevate creators and artists above traditional gatekeepers, but those same commercial dynamics have re-emerged within Solana NFTs and are trying to pressure us into a half-baked governance scheme to take the standard out of the community’s hands. — Metaplex (@metaplex) December 8, 2022\nIn response to allegations that it holds a monopoly over NFTs on Solana, Metaplex said today that it will publish plans to decentralize control of its standard, and that it “[agrees] with the root need to decentralize the program.” However, the firm added that it won’t do so “haphazardly to appease a group that is acting in bad faith.”\nMagic Eden then responded with a tweet thread of its own, writing that Metaplex had “falsely accused us of trying to take control over the NFT standard on SOL.”\n2/ Currently, @metaplex owns the NFT standard the whole ecosystem is built on. Their plan is to commercially govern the standard for their token holders. They have a god mode key that allows them to change how it works & plan to govern it for the benefit of their token holders. — Magic Eden 🪄 (@MagicEden) December 8, 2022\nThe marketplace then alleged that Metaplex is trying to retain control of the standard for the benefit of holders of its MPLX governance token, which it launched in September. Magic Eden said that it and other Solana builders had given feedback to Metaplex regarding its plans, but suggested that Metaplex held undue influence over Solana’s NFT standard.\n“[Metaplex has] a god mode key that allows them to change how it works,” Magic Eden tweeted about the standard functionality, “and plan to govern it for the benefit of their token holders.”\nAD\nAD\nAsk yourself how it feels that they can fire a missile at you that freezes your NFT in place without you doing a thing. It may be for your own good, sure, but how does it feel? As the guy who designed that missile, it makes me feel like an asshole. — jprince.sol (@redacted_j) December 8, 2022\nThis isn’t the first time that Magic Eden and Metaplex have been at odds over the direction of the Solana NFT ecosystem, but the dispute is spilling into the public like never before.\nBack in August, a source close to Metaplex told Decrypt that Magic Eden’s approach to taking custody of users’ listed NFTs was a potential security risk, and that Magic Eden had rebuffed attempts by Metaplex to help open up its closed-source code. Magic Eden’s marketplace is based on early Metaplex code, but has been heavily modified and closed off.\nLately, Magic Eden and Metaplex appear to be taking diverging paths around the contentious issue of enforcing creator royalties on secondary market NFT sales. A creator royalty is a small fee, typically between 5% and 10% of the sale price, paid by the seller automatically to the original creator of the project through the marketplace in question.\nRoyalties cannot be fully enforced on-chain with the current standards on Solana and Ethereum alike, however. Magic Eden moved to make paying royalties optional for traders in October after a wave of rival marketplaces—which had already made similar moves—stole away a significant chunk of its market share.\nMetaplex then announced plans to develop a new royalties-enforcing NFT asset class standard, MIP-1, which is due to roll out in January. However, Magic Eden announced its own protocol last week, which lets creators of new Solana NFT projects block those assets from being traded on marketplaces that don’t honor royalties.\nMagic Eden CEO Jack Lu told Decrypt last week that it had shared its tool with Metaplex in advance of the announcement. However, in a Twitter Spaces today, Lu shared that he was frustrated over what he said were delays on Metaplex’s side to finish the MIP-1 standard.\n“Magic Eden has been eating shit the whole time,” Lu said in the Spaces regarding its move to make royalties optional, suggesting that Metaplex had dragged its feet on a solution. “There’s no urgency here.”\nOn the Magic Eden-hosted Spaces, which Metaplex refused to participate in, Prince said that Magic Eden and other companies in the space had proposed a new decentralized governance model for Metaplex’s token metadata standard, which would see seven individual companies or projects on Solana each have three votes over the system.\nAccording to Prince, other proposed participants beyond Metaplex and Magic Eden would have included Solana wallet maker Phantom and analytics firm Hello Moon. Prince said that Metaplex dismissed the proposal, alleging that Magic Eden and its allies were colluding to steal away control of the Solana NFT standard. Metaplex’s tweets today line up with that view.\nAD\nAD\nLu added in the Spaces that Magic Eden intended to support Metaplex’s new asset standard, but that Metaplex needed to decentralize governance of its token metadata standard first.\nI am pushing for us to use social consensus to bring royalties back, now. Then we can calmly discuss the implications of the protocol solutions being presented to us. It's too confusing to keep track of all the different solutions from ME, Cardinal, Metaplex, HyperSpace, etc. — Frank (@frankdegods) December 8, 2022\nAll the while, Rohun “Frank” Vora—creator of DeGods and y00ts, two of Solana’s largest NFT projects—began pushing on Wednesday for Solana NFT marketplaces to opt back into enforcing royalties as a means of “social consensus.” Frank had previously removed royalty fees from his collections in October as marketplaces broadly pushed back against them.\nNearly two months after Magic Eden’s royalties shift, the Solana ecosystem is still wrestling with the aftermath and how to ultimately pursue a path forward that supports creators. But if the latest accusations between Metaplex and Magic Eden are any indication, it may be difficult to find consensus with two of its most vital participants so publicly at odds."}, {"date": "2022-12-08 22:35:53", "entity": ["ftc", "activision blizza", "microsoft", "ftc", "activision", "microsoft", "fallout", "elder scrolls", "starfield", "redfall", "microsoft", "zenimax", "bethesda softworks", "ftc", "microsoft", "meta", "meta", "federal trade commission", "microsoft", "activision blizza", "overwatch", "microsoft", "microsoft", "ftc", "microsoft", "ftc", "microsoft", "microsoft", "microsoft", "microsoft", "microsoft", "ftc", "microsoft", "activision bli activision blizza", "microsoft", "microsoft", "meta", "sony", "metaverse", "ftc", "microsoft", "bethesda games studios"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "On Thursday, the Federal Trade Commission announced a lawsuit to block Microsoft from acquiring Activision Blizzard, developers of the Call of Duty and Overwatch franchises.

But the approach and implementation didn’t sit right with everyone, and now OpenSea is again changing its policies following complaints from some Web3 builders.\nCreator royalties are fees that are associated with the sale of NFTs, typically set between 5% and 10% of the sale price, paid by the seller to the creators of a given NFT project. For projects that generate significant trading volume, these fees can be a substantial source of revenue. And the rejection of these fees in recent months from NFT traders and most marketplaces has threatened that revenue.\nAD\nAD\nIn a tweet thread today, OpenSea revealed a number of tweaks to its own approach to NFT royalties, including the formation of the Creator Ownership Research Institute (CORI), a group that will oversee curation of the list of Ethereum marketplaces blocked by what's known as the \"Operator Filter\" tool as well as policies related to its development.\n2/ The revolutionary potential of creator fees has been under attack for months. Marketplaces that do not respect creator fees have been rapidly growing in prominence, and creators, in turn, have seen their effective creator fees severely diminished. — OpenSea (@opensea) December 8, 2022\nCORI includes OpenSea, along with a number of other NFT marketplace and smart contract builders, including Nifty Gateway, Zora, Manifold, SuperRare, and Foundation. The firms will use a multi-signature wallet—the kind that requires more than a single actor to sign a transaction—to make changes to the registry, and OpenSea tweeted that it is also “expanding governance of the registry to include more stakeholders, including—critically—voices in the creator community.”\nOpenSea CEO Devin Finzer told Decrypt in a November interview that the marketplace intended to decentralize governance of its blocklist tool as it continued building upon the original iteration.\nThat’s just one piece of OpenSea’s changing approach in the face of criticism regarding the rollout of its blocklist tool. Another has to do with how rapidly it required the tool for new projects. On November 8, just days after announcing the tool, OpenSea began enforcing creator royalties on new NFT projects that implemented its code into their smart contracts. A smart contract contains the code that powers autonomous decentralized apps (dapps), including NFT projects.\nThe following day, OpenSea said that it would also continue to enforce royalties on all NFT projects that were minted before that date, following backlash from creators over prospective changes. But any project that deployed on or after November 8 without the Operator Filter tool implemented would no longer receive royalties from trades on OpenSea.\nThat detail may have been unclear to some creators. In other cases, creators have opted not to utilize the tool, as they see it as an affront to decentralization or a monopolistic move by a market leader acting against rivals that were threatening its dominance.\nEarlier Thursday, Art Blocks founder and CEO Erick Calderon described OpenSea’s approach as a “bully move” in a tweet thread, and called the tool “malware.” An Art Blocks project launched this week without the tool equipped, and OpenSea had not required traders to pay creator fees, prompting Calderon’s response.\nAD\nAD\nOpenSea said today that it will instead adjust its enforcement deadline to January 2, 2023, which means that new projects launched on or after November 8 that did not implement the blocklist tool will now have creator royalties enforced on the marketplace anyway.\nOpenSea specifically mentioned Manifold, a partner in the formation of CORI, as a smart contract maker that had been negatively impacted by the changes. Manifold recently tweeted that it was “working with OpenSea and fighting to get creators’ royalties enabled” on projects that were deployed between November 8-30 using its contract code.\n“This has been a very hard month for the community, and we acknowledge that at times the choices we made were hasty and unaccommodating to some creators’ needs,” OpenSea tweeted in the thread. “There are ultimately no perfect solutions to the industry’s drift away from respecting creator fees.”\n4/ In addition to theses changes OpenSea has pledge their support for on-chain royalties meaning support for EIP-2981 and https://t.co/5wI4yWdRvM will be coming. A win for royalty adoption all around This also means that token level royalties may be possible in the future. — manifold.xyz (マ,マ) (@manifoldxyz) December 8, 2022\nIf NFT creators launch projects on or after January 2 without the Operator Filter tool enabled, then they will be able to set a royalty fee that will be “optional for collectors to comply with,” OpenSea tweeted. That will mark the first time that OpenSea has made royalties optional for traders, albeit solely for that particular subset of future collections.\nThe Operator Filter tool will also be updated to require creators to use Ethereum’s EIP-2981 standard to be “their objective source of truth for creator fee preferences,” OpenSea tweeted. That requirement will take effect as of January 2.\nOpenSea acknowledged in the thread that it had “heard compelling pushback from creators on the lack of an alternative mechanism for earning creator fees on OpenSea outside of leveraging our enforcement tool.”\nCreator royalties have been under attack in the NFT space in recent months. New platforms cut out royalty fees or made them optional in an effort to attract traders, and the growing momentum cut into the market share of leaders that had already enforced them. Top Solana marketplace Magic Eden followed suit and made royalties optional for buyers to pay instead.\nLast week, Magic Eden launched its own similar Solana blocklist tool, saying that it would enforce royalties for only those collections—while blocking marketplaces that don’t support it. Existing projects on Solana still do not have royalties enforcement protection on Magic Eden.\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to add Devin Finzer's previous comments about decentralizing control of its blocklist tool.\nAD\nAD"}, {"date": "2022-12-08 20:19:42", "entity": ["ftx", "u. s. securities and exchange commission", "department of justice", "commodity futures trading commission", "texas state securities board", "department of financial protection and innovation", "stanford law school", "decrypt", "stanford", "fried", "stanford", "ftx", "stanford", "stanford", "stanford", "nytimes", "dealbook", "twitter", "bank ftx"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The parents of disgraced former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will no longer be teaching at Stanford next year, The San Francisco Standard has reported.\nJoseph Bankman, who has been teaching at Stanford Law School since 1988, will no longer be teaching a class at the university this winter.

Its order book was crucial for DeFi on Solana, integrated into virtually all of the biggest DeFi projects on the network, like Jupiter and Raydium.\nAD\nAD\nBut its private keys were housed within FTX—which is exactly as bad as that sounds.\nFollowing an apparent hack on FTX on November 11, the same day that the company filed for bankruptcy, DeFi projects on Solana rushed to cut ties with Serum out of fear that the private key that could be used to update the program had likewise been compromised. This effectively flipped the “off” switch on Solana DeFi.\nConfirming that we turned off @ProjectSerum as a liquidity source a few hours ago due to security concerns about upgrade authorities, and we also encouraged all our integrators to do the same.

Its proponents say DeFi doesn’t leave the fate of an entire protocol in the hands of one person.\nExcept when it does.\n“The Serum program update key was not controlled by the SRM DAO, but by a private key connected to FTX,” pseudonymous developer Mango Max wrote in a thread on Twitter on November 12, saying he’d been in touch with new FTX CEO John Ray. “At this moment no one can confirm who controls this key and hence has the power to update the Serum program, possibly deploying malicious code.”\nI woke up this morning to the devastating news that FTX security was breached last night. It is not clear which parts have been compromised, but a general warning was issued by John Ray the new CEO. (1) — Mango Max 🅱️🧑‍🌾🥭🦀 (@m_schneider) November 13, 2022\nThat Serum’s private key was compromised was bad enough. The revelation that a centralized exchange, not the Serum community, had unilateral access to it was worse. To put that kind of shock in perspective: It’s as if the Ethereum DeFi community found that Coinbase controls the private keys to Maker or Uniswap.\nIn the past month, DeFi volume on Solana has dropped below $20 million, down by 75%, according to DeFi Llama. But there’s still $293 million in total value locked in DeFi on the network and developers, like former Coinbase engineer Mert Mumtaz, are trying to rally people to keep the ecosystem alive.\n“DeFi on Solana has taken a hit, but it’s coming back stronger than ever,” he said on Twitter on Monday afternoon. In the tweet, he said that Helius, the development platform of which he’s CEO and co-founder, would provide free subscriptions to Solana developers.\nDeFi on Solana has taken a hit but it's coming back stronger than ever To help, we (@heliuslabs) are offering free subscriptions (RPCs, APIs, and Webhooks) for anyone helping build the future of SOL DeFi DMs are open — mert | Helius (🧱, ⚡) (@0xMert_) December 5, 2022\nBut free help has its limits, and OpenBook still needs a sustainable way to compensate developers who work on the project.\nOne of Serum’s features was its utility token, SRM, which granted holders a 50% discount on trading fees and access to the governance process. Now court documents from FTX’s bankruptcy proceedings show that the company, which helped create Serum, counted $5.4 billion worth of SRM tokens in its reserves. FTX’s stash, which is almost certainly going to be liquidated to satisfy creditor claims, accounts for 97% of the token’s supply.\nAD\nAD\nTaking SRM out of the equation for OpenBook has been an easy decision for the community. “OpenBook aims to have nothing to do with SRM,” Soju, head of business development at Solana lender Solend, wrote in the project’s Discord last week.\nSoju ran the project’s community call on Monday morning, during which there was plenty of debate on whether OpenBook needs a token at all. A couple of people on the call wondered aloud if they could count on the Solana Foundation for grants that would make it worthwhile for developers to keep working on the project.\n“The foundation is very keen on funding grants, at least for the foreseeable future, for OpenBook development so that we can maintain this core piece of liquidity infrastructure for DeFi, however that well is not infinite,” Ben Sparango, head of business development at Solana Labs, said during the call. “Each one of these grants will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. So it’s not going to be free money forever.”\nHe later pointed out that an upcoming Solana Foundation hackathon in January would focus on DeFi and encouraged OpenBook to submit requests for proposals, which would push some of the work to hackathon participants.\nBut grants and hackathons don’t add up to a sustainable DeFi project. As pseudonymous developer Jimthereaper put it during the call: “Grants don’t work.”\nDeveloper Mango Max pointed out that there has always been some trepidation around DeFi on Solana because of Alameda’s involvement with Serum.\n”There’s always this element when you have a big stakeholder, like Alameda was in the ecosystem, that some people are like, ‘Oh there’s nothing for me to do here.’ And as for the liquidity side, a lot of traders were cautious to come to Solana because they thought, ‘Oh, it’s just like trading on FTX.’ Then at the same time, there were people who were cautious to launch an order book because that was Alameda territory,” he said during the call. “Now, there’s a clear sign that people can start working on stuff and they want to do it as part of a community effort.”\nIn some respects, the Solana DeFi ecosystem always seemed crowded with Bankman-Fried’s Serum as a central piece of infrastructure and Alameda Research relying heavily on yield farming—the practice of providing liquidity to automated market makers in exchange for token rewards. The former FTX CEO was known to be so enamored with it as a strategy that he infamously described yield farming as a “box” on Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast, saying investors put money into DeFi protocols and then take profits out.\nIt’s a comparison that drew lots of criticism for sounding a lot like a Ponzi scheme, which lures new investors and uses their money to pay profits to earlier investors as long as the originator can keep the ruse up.\nOn-chain data shows that with at least 18 different tokens, Alameda Research would accumulate assets, earn yield on them, and then sell its stash on the market right after prices spiked following their listing on FTX, according to compliance firm Argus.\nAD\nAD\nBut now the original Serum protocol has ground to a halt. Even if it still has a long way to go, OpenBook has already managed to integrate with Jupiter, Raydium and Prism since it launched and did $1.8 million in volume over the past day.\nSolana's \"crucible moment\"\nDuring the third quarter, there were signs that Solana’s DeFi ecosystem was starting to mature and stabilize—even if the bear market has been brutal on prices expressed in U.S. dollars, wrote Messari analyst James Trautman in a recent State of Solana report.\nIn fact, it’s the distribution of total value locked—a DeFi metric typically abbreviated as TVL—across DeFi protocols that helped mitigate the risk of any one project bringing the whole thing down.\n“Some top networks by TVL have exposure to single applications with anywhere from 50-60% of the ecosystem's TVL,” Trautman writes. “In contrast, no single Solana application appears ‘too big to fail,’ with Solana’s largest DeFi protocol, Solend, capturing only 14% of TVL at the end of Q3.”\nAs of Wednesday, DeFi volume on Solana over the past day was $27 million—less than 2% of volume in the entire DeFi ecosystem, according to DeFi Llama, which tracks activity on 78 different blockchains.\nSolana DeFi volume hit an all-time high of $568 million on November 9, the day $800 million worth of SOL tokens held by validators were set to unlock. If the tokens had suddenly hit markets, it could have tanked SOL’s already lagging price. To head off calamity, the Solana Foundation halved the number of unlocking tokens and restaked its own supply, meaning it recommitted a substantial portion of SOL tokens to the network and prevented them from hitting the market.\nEarlier that day, Solana co-founder Raj Gokal described the events leading up to it all as the network's \"crucible moment.\"\nthis crucible moment for @solana ecosystem is as difficult as the last one. the difference is, there are 10x more of us to band together this time. next time, there will be 10x more. and each time, we're stronger. the fundamentals are better. same goes for crypto at large, tbh — raj 🖤 (@rajgokal) November 9, 2022\nBut the direction that Serum's successor appears to be going could, in the end, be a boon for SOL, as it further escapes the shadow of FTX. There have even been calls for SOL to become the token that grants discounts and gets used to pay developers who work on OpenBook. A tweet about it from pseudonymous NFT collector R89Capital gained some traction last week as Solana co-founder Yakovenko, Mango Max, and Helius’s Mumtaz all chimed in.\nSomeone floated the idea of using $SOL as the @openbookdex token. This must happen. Would make Serums replacement truly a community owned public utility and add more value accrual to the token. — R89 (@R89Capital) November 27, 2022\nAD\nAD\nYakovenko said he was against it because OpenBook presented the opportunity to launch a completely fresh token, “with no pre-mine or bullshit and see what happens.” Mumtaz seemed intrigued, but didn’t say whether he’d support it. Mango Max said last week and repeated on Monday morning’s call that he’d prefer not to introduce a token to OpenBook.\nJohn Kramer, co-founder of Dual Finance, said during the call on Monday that he feared a token is inevitable and the Solana DeFi community that forked Serum to launch OpenBook should take the opportunity now to create some guidelines around how it happens.\n”I think it’s inevitable there will be a token, so why not spend some time to figure out what that might look like. We don’t actually have to implement anything, but if we’re going to get community buy-in, then we should have some sort of a say in what that looks like,” he said, “because human nature just demands that it will eventually happen. People are going to want to be incentivized to work.”"}, {"date": "2022-12-07 22:03:36", "entity": ["bitcoin", "btc", "btc", "ftx", "u. s. federal reserve"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral"], "content": "Bitcoin (BTC): The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $16,800, down about a percentage point over the past 24 hours.

ConstitutionDAO2.\nWhile ConstitutionDAO2 sounds like a bad movie sequel, the group assured its followers via Twitter late Tuesday night that it will “come back stronger, faster, and smarter” this time around. On its website, the DAO also refers to itself as “UnumDAO.”\nWe are gonna buy the Constitution! (again) But this time we will win! (📜,📜) Here's the story on how we come back stronger, faster, and smarter 🧵 👇 — ConstitutionDAO2 (📜,📜) (@WAGBTC) December 7, 2022\nIn November, Sotheby’s announced it would auction the second of two private copies of the first printing of the Constitution. (Griffin purchased the first one, the Goldman Constitution, last year.) The copy up for auction this year has not been sold in over 125 years, says Sotheby’s, and is worth approximately $20 million to $30 million. In the 19th Century, the copy was given as a gift to Adrian Van Sinderen, who later became a prominent book collector.\nIn a public Twitter poll, 83% of respondents said they wanted a DAO to try again to purchase a copy of the document.\nHow will it be different this time? ConstitutionDAO2 says it will offer donators the ability to make private Ethereum (ETH) donations, thus making it more difficult for competing bidders to know the total funding pool and bid slightly above that value. But that’s not exactly a foolproof plan.\nA lot has changed in crypto since the last time a DAO tried to buy a copy of the constitution. Crypto winter has set in, Bitcoin and Ethereum prices have collapsed, startups have gone bankrupt, and investors are down bad. Raising ETH in this market for such an audacious goal will likely be even more difficult than it was a year ago. Nevertheless, ConstitutionDAO2 is pressing forward.\nAD\nAD\n“ConstitutionDAO2 wants to buy the printing from Sotheby’s so that it can start a collection of civic artifacts that are totally run by the people,” the DAO wrote on Twitter. “We are going to teach the world about democratic innovations found in history and on web3.”\nIt’s also worth noting that the original ConstitutionDAO never really went away—it just rebranded to PeopleDAO after it lost, very publicly, to Griffin. As a part of its original structuring, the ConstitutionDAO launched a governance token, PEOPLE, which is up 12% in the past two weeks but still down 87% from its all-time high of roughly $0.18 last December, per CoinGecko data.\nConstitutionDAO also faced some challenges when it realized that in order to refund its contributors, those individuals would have to pay the cost of Ethereum gas fees and thus would not receive full refunds.\nIt’s currently unclear to what extent ConstitutionDAO2 is made up of original ConstitutionDAO participants, but the sequel DAO says it has the support of many other crypto-focused groups, such as Aztec, LanguageDAO, Nucleo, MoonDAO, 404DAO, Empire DAO, the funding platform Juice Box, and the original PeopleDAO, to name a few."}, {"date": "2022-12-07 20:02:50", "entity": ["lensa", "chatgpt", "twitter. com", "eouaackxim", "openai", "chatgpt", "t. co", "chat chatgpt", "openai", "asimov", "openai", "dao ukraine dao", "monkey", "smart contract + isaac chatgpt", "chatgpt", "issac py", "chatgpt", "t. co", "daos", "quantum", "chatgpt"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "While digital selfies created by the artificial intelligence app Lensa have taken over social feeds and profile pictures, text-based artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT is taking Crypto Twitter by storm.\ncongrats to OpenAI on winning the Turing Test pic.twitter.com/eOuaACKXim — Max Woolf (@minimaxir) December 6, 2022\nAD\nAD\nLaunched in November by OpenAI, ChatGPT has seen a flood of interest due to its surprisingly coherent and in-depth responses to questions ranging from how to exploit a smart contract to how the world will end.\nAI (ChatGPT) can exploit a solidity smart contract.

Liquidators can now request “any recorded information, including books, documents, records, and papers” related to the hedge fund’s property or financial affairs since 2012, when the company was founded, according to the court order.\nAD\nAD\nThree Arrows Capital, which also goes by 3AC, filed for Chapter 15 bankruptcy protection in July. Chapter 15 is a designation that allows for cooperation between U.S. courts and those in the British Virgin Islands, where 3AC is registered.\nAlthough it wasn’t the only reason, 3AC’s co-founders have said publicly that they lost $200 million when Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), lost its one-to-one peg with the U.S. dollar and went to zero.\nAfter UST crashed and rumors swirled that 3AC had suffered a huge loss, BitMEX, FTX, and Derebit liquidated 3AC’s positions.\nThe firm frequently used leveraged positions, meaning exchanges allowed it to trade with more funds than it actually had in hand. It’s a risky strategy, but increases the potential profits. If a position becomes too risky, an exchange can ask traders to add more of their own money to cover the margin. That’s what’s called a “margin call.” And when firms can’t meet a margin call, exchanges will liquidate their funds to cover their losses.\nVoyager Digital, which itself filed for bankruptcy only days later, issued 3AC a default notice for an outstanding balance of more than $600 million.\nZhu and Davies seemingly disappeared after the order to liquidate, but they have since become vocal on social media in the wake of FTX’s bankruptcy.\nFTX founder and then-CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was critical of Terra after it collapsed and said on Twitter that 3AC’s own collapse “couldn't have happened with an on-chain protocol that was transparent.” Throughout the summer Bankman-Fried was vocal about wanting to stop the contagion that was threatening to bring down other crypto firms, including Voyager Digital and BlockFi—both of which have now had to file for bankruptcy protection.\nThings started to unwind for FTX when it was revealed that a large portion of the balance sheet at Alameda Research, Bankman-Fried’s trading desk, included FTX Token (FTT) and was illiquid. After that news broke, there was a mass sell-off of FTT and, within a week, FTX filed for bankruptcy and Bankman-Fried resigned.\nAD\nAD\nYesterday Zhu alleged on Twitter that former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried sold and shorted clients’ Bitcoin and Ethereum deposits for Solana and FTX Token.\n“This is not just a crime [against] clients it's a crime [against] crypto,” the 3AC co-founder wrote. “He internalized billions of client buy flow for actual coins into his own shitcoins.”\nMeanwhile, Davies has said himself on Twitter that FTX and its sister company, trading desk Alameda Research, “hunted” 3AC’s trades. Within the last day, he asked where “all the FTX fanboys” have gone, saying that they “worshipped SBF’s every sneeze and were highly critical of 3AC’s.”\nThe Tuesday morning order granting permission to subpoena 3AC leadership also includes communication with: Zhu and Davies; the firm’s third director, Mark James Dubois; Davies’ wife, Kelly Kaili Chen, who lent money to the firm; Tai Ping Shin, a Cayman Islands-based company owned by Zhu and Chen; DeFiance Capital and its manager, Arthur Cheong; and Starry Night Capital, the firm’s NFT fund and its pseudonymous curator, Vincent Van Dough.\nLast week, the Singapore high court gave the 3AC co-founders one week to submit affidavits after attempts to obtain information from Solitaire, one of the firm’s law firms, went unanswered. The next day, liquidators announced that they had seized $35 million worth of 3AC’s assets and were seeking information on the now-infamous $30 million “Much Wow” superyacht."}, {"date": "2022-12-06 19:29:23", "entity": ["nft", "pippen", "nft", "pippen"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "As part of the collection, one NFT holder with premium access will receive a VIP tour of Pippen’s hometown Hamburg, Arkansas, including a private dinner.

Spinnin’ Records is a major player in the electronic dance music space, and has released tracks from artists like David Guetta, Tiesto, R3HAB, and Robin Shultz.\nElectronic dance musicians have leaned into crypto and Web3 arguably more than any other genre, and Warner’s move only continues that trend. Deadmau5, Steve Aoki, 3LAU, and Dillon Francis are among the biggest electronic artists that have bought or sold NFTs and advocated for the technology.\nBut LGND doesn’t necessarily want to push the concept of self-custody—where users hold their own assets in a decentralized wallet like MetaMask—on its users. For many crypto enthusiasts, self-custody is an essential upside to Web3, allowing holders to custody their own private keys to their assets and avoid centralized risk.\nFor more mass-market platforms like LGND, self-custody and crypto wallets are sometimes seen as a complicated—or even unnecessary—aspect when it comes to onboarding mainstream users.\n“LGND Music will never force you to connect a cryptocurrency wallet to explore the platform, and will keep all your assets safe in your collection,” its website reads. That said, users who prefer self-custody will have the option to connect their own wallets if desired.\nAD\nAD\nPolygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt said in a statement that he believes Polygon’s partnership with WMG and LGND is an “exciting milestone for the music industry.”\n“The way that we own and experience music is evolving, by fully embracing decentralized technologies and collectibles,” Wyatt added.\nWMG has forged a number of Web3 partnerships this year. In January, it announced plans to bring metaverse concerts and events into The Sandbox, and followed that up in February with a pact with crypto game Splinterlands to develop “arcade-style” games around its artists.

Sam did himself zero favors with this. “I wasn’t even trying to manage risk.” Sam feels the need to speak and is going against all legal counsel — a huge mistake born from hubris. pic.twitter.com/s5iBFiqkOs — Autism Capital 🧩 (@AutismCapital) December 1, 2022\nThomas Gorman, a partner at the law firm Dorsey & Whitney LLP who specializes in defending SEC investigations and enforcement actions and criminal white collar securities cases, agreed that FTX’s Bahamas HQ complicated things.\n“That creates some problems, because you’ve got different laws governing different aspects of the organization,” he told Decrypt. “That will ultimately impact who gets charged for what—assuming anyone gets charged.”\nFor what it’s worth, the Bahamas does have an extradition treaty with the U.S., should it come to that.\nGorman said that despite the fact that SBF is being investigated by “everyone you think of in Washington, D.C.,” none has made a determination as to whether criminal charges need to be brought forward. And if criminal charges are brought forward, it will be some time before anyone is behind bars.\nIn the meantime, while SBF has the right to remain silent to avoid incriminating himself, he’s been anything but silent, granting several high-profile and heavily scrutinized interviews, and continuing to post to Twitter.\nOne possibility is that SBF is now engaged in a “charm campaign” to minimize his guilt, asserting that he didn’t know or didn’t understand what was happening. Speaking at the New York Times DealBook Summit last week, he claimed he “didn’t knowingly commingle funds.”\nAs Slamowitz added, “Optics and public opinion remain an integral part of the crypto ecosystem in determining whether to prosecute.\"\nMiriam Baer, vice dean and a centennial professor of law at Brooklyn Law School, told Decrypt that “SBF benefits in a way from his loquaciousness. The more he says, the stronger his claim that he’s just this naive guy who is in over his head.” She added that federal agents and prosecutors would be scrutinizing all of his statements for inconsistencies and provable falsehoods.\nIf SBF is using incompetence as an excuse, will the authorities buy it? Industry watchers will have to wait and see.\nAD\nAD\n“It’s a big story that will be around for a long time,” Gorman said.\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to add comments from Miriam Baer."}, {"date": "2022-12-06 02:00:04", "entity": ["bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Negative"], "content": "The reality of crypto winter now seems to have caught up with the industry, and bitcoin miners are turning off their machines.

Breitman agrees the governance process behind many Web3 projects can often be lackluster.\n“A lot of blockchains and DAOs are run like suggestion boxes,” she said.\nBaking decentralization into a Web3 project’s structure is key to its longevity, said Breitman, even if that means there’s no central figure that can capture widespread attention. She explained that enforcing decisions programmatically through votes with the Tezos ecosystem has kept people engaged.\nAD\nAD\n“Because there actually is a consequence to your vote, and it's not just a suggestion box, people are automatically empowered,” she said. “I think it’s that empowerment that really leads people to engage in the process.”\nUpgrades to the Tezos protocol put forth by developers are approved in votes by people who hold the cryptocurrency. The system is built in a way that prevents it from being susceptible to a hard fork, which happens when a contentious upgrade to a blockchain network causes it to diverge down two separate paths, such as what happened with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\nTezos is the 46th ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization according to CoinGecko, with a collective market value of $924 million. It reached an all time high of $9.12 in October of last year and currently trades at $1.01 as of this writing.\nBreitman asserted that many projects in Web3 are engaged in “decentralization theater,” representing themselves as entities that embody ideals central to crypto, yet prioritizing mass participation over growing communities in an organic way.\n“We've had a lot of tourists in this space who have launched different tokens, and then they have these really aggressive programs that give high yields for people to participate in these ecosystems,” she said. “And at some point … the money box goes out because momentum stops building up.”\nListen and subscribe to the gm podcast wherever you get your podcasts."}, {"date": "2022-12-05 02:28:32", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "First Mover Asia: Bitcoin Hovers Near $17.3K, but Does It Have Staying Power?\nALSO: Sam Reynolds writes that DeFi total value has been rallying recently after tumbling in mid-November, a sign that investors believe in DeFi's potential."}, {"date": "2022-12-05 00:48:22", "entity": ["lbc", "sbf", "fried", "ftx", "alameda research", "t. co", "coinbase", "t. co", "twitter", "lbry", "u. s. securities and exchange", "house of representatives financial services committee", "capitol hill", "ftx", "ftx", "ftx", "altruism", "cnbc", "ftx", "york times", "ftx"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried today replied to a Friday invitation from U.S. Rep.

Protestors were demonstrating against the country’s ongoing draconian COVID measures, prompting fears that the world’s second largest economy may be getting disrupted.\nThe market also dipped on Monday on news that crypto lender BlockFi was filing for bankruptcy. BlockFi is the latest in a long line of crypto companies to get hit with contagion following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.\nRisk assets recovered on Wednesday when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech that December would bring smaller interest rate hikes.

On Monday, Brazil’s congress took a step further than most and passed a bill legally approving crypto for payments for goods and services in crypto.\nThe bill, which still needs presidential approval, includes crypto and airline travel rewards in the definition of \"payment agreements\" under the supervision of the country's central bank.\nAD\nAD\nThe following day, the European Central Bank published a damning paper that argued that Bitcoin’s lengthy price stabilization at around $20k before FTX’ collapsed may have been “an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.”\nIn the blog post, ECB’s Market Infrastructure & Payments Director General Ulrich Bindseil and advisor Jürgen Schaff also argue that “Bitcoin's conceptual design and technological shortcomings make it questionable as a means of payment.”\nBitcoin friendly U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY)—who co-sponsors a bipartisan House bill called The Responsible Financial Innovation Act calling for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to be the industry’s chief regulator—on Monday said in a pre-recorded address to the Financial Times’s Crypto and Digital Asset Summit that FTX’s collapse highlights the need for Congress to “learn more” about crypto.\nKnown as the \"Bitcoin Senator\" for her cryptocurrency advocacy on Capitol Hill, Lummis touted her bill as a “framework” for understanding how the FTX disaster could have been prevented.\nShe also noted that FTX was \"heavily involved\" in drafting the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA), which is backed by Senate Agriculture Committee Chairwoman Sen.

(art: Grant Kempster)\nThere’s been a ton of chatter about wrapped tokens like Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) this week—some of it legitimate, some of it top-tier shitposting.\nAD\nAD\nEarlier this week, several notable crypto Twitter accounts began peddling the idea that WETH was on the verge of collapse.\n“ATTENTION: WETH is about to be insolvent,” tweeted crypto influencer Cygaar. “I will begrudgingly bail out anyone holding WETH at a rate of 0.5 ETH per WETH in order to save this space. You can thank me once the crisis has been averted.”\n“We might see a bank run on redeeming WETH soon,” tweeted Gnosis co-founder Martin Köppelmann.\nNone of this was true.\nUnlike the bank-run tweets that swirled around Twitter amid the FTX collapse, WETH doesn’t have the same counterparty risk. There is no centralized organization custodying the underlying Ethereum. There are no over-leveraged funds in the Bahamas taking a massive risk with user funds.\nInstead, the key risk here is smart contract risk.\nTo mint WETH, users deposit Ethereum into a smart contract rather than giving it to an exchange or a crypto lender to hold on to it. The reason people use WETH instead of ETH (after all, they’re basically the same thing, right?) is that it, unlike Ethereum, is also an ERC-20 token. This makes it much easier to integrate into various decentralized applications.\nThus, there was never a risk of insolvency or a bank run on this asset. It’s simply another example of the rather obnoxious sense of humor that exists in the industry. Sure, the smart contract could somehow break down, but it has existed and operated smoothly for so long that something like that would’ve already happened by now if there was some sort of bug.\nWBTC, however, is much different.\nAD\nAD\n“BitGo is the custodian for the BTC backing for wBTC,” wrote Rugdoc.io, a community-driven project that reviews smart contracts. “Bitgo froze FTX assets, creating a 4k surplus of BTC and the wBTC depeg. It's not your Bitcoin if you hold wBTC.”\nThis asset basically lets you create an Ethereum-compatible version of Bitcoin so that it can be used in different DeFi applications. Even more simply, it’s an ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Bitcoin.\nIt’s also backed by real Bitcoin, which, as mentioned above, is custodied by a firm called BitGo. For every 1 WBTC in circulation, BitGo has 1 real Bitcoin.\nWhenever a user wants to “unwrap” their WBTC and redeem it for the real deal, they must go through a merchant (this could be an exchange, for example). Doing this means destroying (or burning) that WBTC and withdrawing one of the Bitcoin from custody.\nCritically, you can also see this minting and burning activity occurring on-chain thanks to a convenient dashboard.\nLast week WBTC depegged in price from the underlying Bitcoin, which—given its design—was actually a bit more worrisome (and not necessarily a mean-spirited Twitter joke).\nWrapped Bitcoin discount. Image: Kaiko.\nNormally, when a discount like this emerges, market makers will swoop in and arbitrage the difference for profit by buying the cheaper WBTC and redeeming it for the real Bitcoin.\nAnd that’s pretty much what they’ve been doing here, too. But because Alameda (the sister trading firm to the collapse FTX) was a huge WBTC user, their absence left a lot of arbitrage to do.\nThus, the market is doing a bit of catch-up as well as battling some serious FUD along the way.\nRight now, WBTC is trading at roughly a $15 discount to the real deal. That’s peanuts. And it’s likely made some market makers all the richer along the way.\nAD\nAD\nDecrypting DeFi is our DeFi newsletter, led by this essay.

But after releasing the first entry in July, the company confirmed to Decrypt today that it has paused further production of the series.\n“We are constantly evolving our content strategy and have decided to pause production of the remaining two films while we identify the best path forward for the creative,” a Coinbase spokesperson told Decrypt. “We will continue to focus on more immediate creative endeavors.”\nAD\nAD\nThe spokesperson declined to elaborate on the reasons for the production halt.\nTHE DEGEN TRILOGY: PART ONE ⛓️RUN THE CHAIN⛓️ Here's a first look at what we've been building with the community 👀📽️ pic.twitter.com/RSV6McnMlw — Coinbase (@coinbase) July 26, 2022\nThe Degen Trilogy had the blessing of Bored Ape Yacht Club creator Yuga Labs, and it was intended to feature various Bored Ape characters submitted by their respective owners. Coinbase’s terms stipulated that it would pay $10,000 worth of Bitcoin or ApeCoin to the owner of each chosen Ape, in exchange for licensing rights for the films.\nThe first installment was released in July via YouTube and social media platforms, with the five-minute CG-animated short introducing human characters on an ApeCoin-themed hunt in a skyscraper filled with “money zombies”—with only a handful of brief Bored Ape appearances.\nIt was widely criticized by the NFT community, with social media commenters knocking the confusing story, lengthy credits sequence, and lack of meaningful Bored Ape Yacht Club elements within the first entry.\nThe timing was also deemed unfortunate by some, as the film launched after Coinbase laid off about 1,100 people in June. “Imagine getting laid off by Coinbase [because] they couldn’t afford to pay you, and then they come out with this,” tweeted pseudonymous NFT artist, Hawkward.\nTHE DEGEN TRILOGY: PART TWO pic.twitter.com/uCi8DD0T6r — Cory at Swan Bitcoin (@coryklippsten) July 27, 2022\nBeyond layoffs, much had changed from April’s announcement to the July rollout. The once-flying NFT space was struggling mightily following May’s crypto market crash, Bored Apes had lost significant value in that same span, and Coinbase’s long-awaited NFT marketplace failed to gain traction after its launch.\nAD\nAD\nMonths later, the situation isn’t any better. NFT sales keep falling month after month, Bored Ape prices recently dropped below $60,000—down from a peak of $429,000 worth of ETH in April—and Coinbase’s stock price has crashed to all-time lows amid continued market struggles.\nThe Coinbase NFT marketplace has yielded only $7 million in trading volume since launching in April. That’s less than leading marketplace OpenSea typically manages in a single day. Coinbase Chief Product Officer Surojit Chatterjee, who had overseen the launch of the marketplace, departed the company in November ahead of additional layoffs.\nIn an August interview with journalist Laura Shin on the Unchained podcast, Chatterjee admitted that the first entry in the Degen Trilogy “probably didn’t hit the mark” for “some people,” and said that it was “something our marketing team tried.” Citing Coinbase’s buzzy Super Bowl ad this year, he added, “Some things are more successful than others.”\nDespite falling Ethereum asset prices, the Bored Ape Yacht Club remains one of the best known and most successful NFT projects to date, racking up more than $2.5 billion in trading volume since its April 2021 mint.

Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney and Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt have voiced similar levels of disgust with the 30% in-app purchase tax.\nAs crypto companies try to build out features for their mobile applications to give users an alternative to browser-only experiences, many are hitting Apple’s tax roadblock and are being rejected or removed from the iOS App Store.\nSuch policies can feel arbitrary in an increasingly digital world. While companies like Amazon are allowed to sell physical goods in their applications without being subject to the tax, crypto companies like OpenSea or Coinbase are not allowed to sell digital goods without being subject to the tax. Digital art (when traded as an NFT) is taxed, while physical art is not.\nAD\nAD\nInstagram, who recently launched in-app NFTs, will implement Apple’s 30% tax onto every NFT sale—a move that makes mobile purchases much less appealing to users.\nIn response to a previous request for comment, Apple told Decrypt that its guidelines apply equally to all who apply to be listed on its App Store.\nIt also pointed to section 3.1.1 of the App Store guidelines, which states that “Apps may not use their own mechanisms to unlock content or functionality, such as license keys, augmented reality markers, QR codes, cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency wallets, etc.”\nApple’s guidelines state that apps are allowed to “use in-app purchase to sell and sell services related to non-fungible tokens (NFTs), such as minting, listing, and transferring,” but those will all be subject to the 30% tax.\nEditor's note: This article was updated after publication to include comments from MetaMask's Dan Finlay."}, {"date": "2022-12-02 18:06:18", "entity": ["capitol hill"], "sentiment": ["Neutral"], "content": "Crypto Is at ‘Brick Wall Stage' and Needs ‘Right Balance’ of Regulation, Says Legal Expert\nPennsylvania State University Dickinson Law Professor Tonya Evans discusses why the ecosystem is in need of thoughtful regulation from lawmakers on Capitol Hill."}, {"date": "2022-12-02 16:40:28", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "Brands Will Save Crypto?

As rumors began to circulate about the embattled hedge fund, crypto exchanges BitMEX, FTX, and Deribit liquidated the firm’s positions when it couldn’t meet margin calls, or add collateral to secure the outstanding balances on its loans.\nThe final blow came when crypto lending company Voyager Digital, itself now bankrupt, revealed Three Arrows owed it $661 million, and issued a formal notice of default.

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) cosponsoredintroduced the Responsible Financial Innovation Act , which she co-sponsored with Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY). At the time, it was said that the bill would end the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s oversight of most of the crypto industry, create a $200 tax exemption for reporting gains on tax returns and shift regulatory responsibilities to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nIt was last discussed during a Senate banking committee hearing on November 15, but not yet been put to a vote.\nRep.

The Arkansas senator co-sponsored the Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act (DCCPA) with Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI).

This is because Apple blocked our last app release until we disabled the feature,” the Coinbase Wallet account shared on Twitter Thursday.\nAD\nAD\nWhile NFTs aren’t outright banned on Apple’s mobile app store, they are subject to a hefty 30% tax on every transaction. If developers aren’t able to implement that requirement, their app will be blocked from the store.\nCoinbase said Apple wants to take a 30% fee on any gas fees (i.e., transaction fees on the Ethereum network) paid on NFT transfers completed through the wallet app, which Coinbase says is “not possible.”\nApple’s claim is that the gas fees required to send NFTs need to be paid through their In-App Purchase system, so that they can collect 30% of the gas fee. — Coinbase Wallet (@CoinbaseWallet) December 1, 2022\n“For anyone who understands how NFTs and blockchains work, this is clearly not possible,” Coinbase said. “Apple’s proprietary In-App Purchase system does not support crypto so we couldn’t comply even if we tried.”\nEvery time a user makes a transaction on the Ethereum network, even when simply transferring an asset like an NFT to a different wallet, the user must pay a fee known as gas. These fees are required for the network to run. But they’re more complicated than a flat fee and can’t be controlled by any single entity.\nGas prices—which are measured in gwei but paid in ETH—vary depending on Ethereum network traffic and the efficiency of a smart contract’s code. And more advanced users can opt to pay more to put their transaction closer to the front of the queue.\nCoinbase is not happy about these restrictions to its mobile application, calling Apple’s decision “akin to Apple trying to take a cut of fees for every email that gets sent over open Internet protocols.”\nApple’s controversial in-app purchase fee has angered many crypto advocates, such as Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, who previously fought Apple’s rules in a lawsuit and said the tech giant “must be stopped.”\nAD\nAD\nFormer YouTube executive and current Polygon Studios CEO Ryan Wyatt has taken a similar stance, calling Apple’s 30% tax “criminal.” Wyatt believes the tax will “forever hold back technological progress due to its monopoly over the industry.”\nAnd Twitter’s billionaire CEO Elon Musk isn’t immune from Apple’s censorship, either, previously expressing concerns that Apple might remove Twitter from its store (Musk then met with Apple CEO Tim Cook on Wednesday, and Cook apparently dispelled those concerns).\nGood conversation. Among other things, we resolved the misunderstanding about Twitter potentially being removed from the App Store. Tim was clear that Apple never considered doing so. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) November 30, 2022\nCoinbase said it hopes this decision was simply “an oversight” and that it can be discussed further. It also believes that Apple’s strict NFT fee policy will make mainstream adoption of NFTs more difficult and will make it more cumbersome for users to transfer their assets.\n“Apple has introduced new policies to protect their profits at the expense of consumer investment in NFTs and developer innovation across the crypto ecosystem,” Coinbase said.\nWhile crypto enthusiasts on Twitter disparaged Apple’s restrictions today, others pointed to the potential of Solana’s Saga phone, a Web3-native mobile device which is still in development and will not have such restrictions. Its current release date is anticipated to be sometime early next year.\n“Today it was Apple, but tomorrow it could be Google,” said Solana’s Head of Communications Austin Federa in response to the news. “We need a 3rd option.”\nApple has not yet responded to Decrypt’s request for comment."}, {"date": "2022-12-01 19:21:07", "entity": [], "sentiment": [], "content": "\"Given the circumstances of the past few weeks, I think we should take a pause and look at the bill and make sure there are no gaps or no holes,\" he said. \"Where the bill may be strengthened [is] disclosures around financial information of the entity, the crypto entity and conflicts of interest, obviously an issue that many members have talked about today, given the brazen conflicts that occurred at the non-regulated entity.\""}, {"date": "2022-12-01 19:12:33", "entity": ["ftx", "alameda research", "ftx", "ftx", "ftx", "enron", "alameda", "ftx", "behnam", "behnam", "ftx ftx", "commodities futures trading commission", "ftx", "ftx"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative"], "content": "Cryptocurrency may be a threat to America’s national security and more regulation is needed in the space now, Commodities Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam said today.\nSenators on Thursday grilled Behnam on lack of regulation in space at the first congressional oversight hearing following the crash of crypto exchange FTX and the fall of its disgraced founder Sam Bankman-Fried.\nAD\nAD\nFTX was one of the biggest and most popular crypto exchanges until it blew up just weeks ago. It is now coming to light how the company’s leadership mismanaged the exchange and its related entities, and was opaque about its books, which led to a remarkably quick bankruptcy—and the loss of billions of dollars worth of customer assets.\nBehnam said cryptocurrency was “potentially a threat to national security” when Senator Roger Wayne Marshall (R-KS), who described the space as a “nuclear bomb going off,” asked about digital assets being used by criminals.\nTalking to members of the Senate Agriculture committee, Behnam added that digital assets will exist even if the U.S. government wanted to ban them from U.S. soil—noting that despite regulations and restrictions known as geofencing, 2% of FTX customers were from the U.S. FTX was a Bahamas-based company, and it ostensibly prohibited U.S. residents from using its services.\n“That’s not supposed to happen,” he said. “Folks will find a way to get exposure to offshore entities and activities, even if it’s prohibited in the U.S.—and we have to do something about that.”\nBehnam told lawmakers that his agency needs to be able to have the power to write rules and oversee crypto trading—including stopping exchanges from having affiliated entities that trade with customers on the platform.\nPart of FTX’s downfall was due to the exchange allegedly using customer money (without them knowing) to make bets through Alameda Research, a trading firm also set up by ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried. Alameda traded on FTX, in effect betting against its own customers, and yet had special permissions on the platform that prevented it from ever being liquidated on the exchange, according to newly appointed FTX CEO John J. Ray (the same Ray who oversaw the liquidation of Enron).\nIn other words, Alameda allegedly used FTX user money to trade against FTX users and played by its own rules.\nAD\nAD\n“We need registration of exchanges; we need surveillance of market activity; we need direct relationships with custodians who are holding customer money so we can prohibit and prevent money moving around that’s not house money,” added Behnam."}, {"date": "2022-12-01 19:00:00", "entity": ["solana", "magic eden"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The Open Creator Protocol (OCP) is an open-source tool built on top of Solana's SPL managed-token standard and will give creators launching new collections the choice of whether they want to have royalties protected.

That’s still true for existing collections.\nCreator royalties are at threat in the NFT space, especially on Solana, where effectively all marketplaces with any significant share have stopped requiring traders to pay the fees. But now the leading Solana marketplace, Magic Eden, has taken a step towards creating a more durable system to enforce creator royalties.\nThe $1.6 billion startup today announced the Open Creator Protocol (OCP), an open-source tool that creators of new Solana NFT projects can implement to ensure that royalties are paid whenever their assets are traded on secondary marketplaces. It’s built on top of Metaplex’s existing SPL token standard for NFTs on Solana.\nAD\nAD\nCreator royalties are fees that are paid, typically by the seller, on NFT trades. They are typically set between 5% and 10% of the sale price, with the funds going to a digital wallet controlled by the creators of the NFT project. These fees can be a lucrative source of revenue for NFT projects that generate significant secondary trading volume.\nMagic Eden's OCP appears to be similar in approach to OpenSea’s recent Ethereum toolkit, allowing NFT creators to block marketplaces that won’t honor royalty fees on eligible assets. In other words, if a marketplace refuses to enforce royalties for OCP-enabled NFTs, then that platform will be put on the OCP blocklist and those NFTs can’t be traded through it.\n“Creators have the option to adopt the Open Creator Protocol, which will allow them to use the protocol to protect their royalties and create their own rules of their collection’s trading,” Magic Eden CEO Jack Lu told Decrypt. “This will only be available to creators launching new collections, but we feel many will opt into the protocol.”\nLu said that Magic Eden itself will maintain a list of blocked marketplaces, but also that creators can choose to customize the list of blocked platforms. The open-source tool—which will be available for creators to use on Friday—can be supported by any Solana NFT marketplace that wishes to honor royalties on OCP projects, he added.\nMagic Eden enforced creator-set royalties until mid-October, when a wave of rival Solana NFT marketplaces began rejecting royalties or making them optional for traders, resulting in more money kept by sellers. Faced with dwindling market share in the Solana NFT space, Magic Eden opted to make royalties optional for buyers to pay, similar to a tip for creators.\nEthereum NFT platforms began following suit, as well, and top overall marketplace OpenSea said in early November that it was considering a similar move. Following creator backlash, however, OpenSea said that it will continue to honor royalties on existing collections, along with new projects that use its Ethereum blocklist tool. Rival marketplace X2Y2 has since taken that approach as well.\nMagic Eden’s new tool only serves creators who adopt it for newly launched projects, however, and the marketplace has not changed course on optional royalties for existing projects. The firm previously pledged $1 million towards the development of royalties enforcement tools, and Lu told Decrypt that creators may choose to re-mint projects using OCP if they wish.\n“It’s not mandatory of course—it’s just an option, in the spirit of being solutions-oriented,” Lu explained. “While that might appear scary for some creators, some remain undaunted and we look forward to working with them.”\nAD\nAD\nMagic Eden built the OCP tool independently of Metaplex, which is developing its own new royalties-enforcing Solana NFT asset class. Lu said that the team has been in contact with Metaplex and had already shared the tool ahead of today’s announcement, noting that Metaplex’s new standard isn’t due until Q1 2023.\n“We don’t foresee any conflict between our protocol and what Metaplex plans to roll out. We want creators to have as much choice as possible,” Lu explained, pointing out that both will support migrating existing collections. “Our goal is for the ecosystem to consolidate a standard that any business can unreservedly build on top of.”\nThe OCP toolkit also enables additional functionality for creators, Magic Eden said. One feature is a dynamic royalty option that uses a linear price curve to cut down the total fee paid by buyers for higher-priced NFTs, potentially making royalties appear less daunting for pricey purchases.\nAnother feature lets creators customize certain transferability details, such as whether NFTs can be resold before the initial mint ends, as well as limits based on NFT metadata—or the details that specify an asset’s unique attributes—or total NFTs traded in a collection to date. Magic Eden suggests that such options can unlock “gamification” opportunities for NFT creators."}, {"date": "2022-12-01 18:44:39", "entity": ["coindesk"], "sentiment": ["Positive"], "content": "By signing up, you will receive emails about CoinDesk products and you agree to ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy."}, {"date": "2022-12-01 17:47:12", "entity": ["apple", "nft", "apple", "nft", "opensea", "nft"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The dispute is the latest in a months-long saga between Apple and the NFT community.

Bankman-Fried, also known as “SBF,” attended the conference virtually from the Bahamas.\nAD\nAD\n“I didn’t knowingly commingle funds” he said. “It was, in effect, tied together substantially more than I would have ever wanted it to be,” he said in reference to the relationship between FTX and Alameda Research, a crypto trading firm he also founded.\nOn-chain data, however, suggests that may not be the case, and that FTX and Alameda have been closely intertwined for some time.\nIn its investigation of the collapse of FTX, and its relationship to the implosion of Terra earlier this year, blockchain analytics company Nansen concluded that Terra's demise \"revealed a deep flaw between Alameda and FTX’s muddled relationship.\" Researchers for Nansen added: “There were significant FTT outflows from Alameda to FTX around the Terra-Luna/3AC situation.”\nA subsequent report from crypto data firm Glassnode echoed those findings, with its own researchers suggesting that the collapse of FTX was \"inevitable\" given what historical blockchain records of transactions between Alameda and FTX demonstrate.\nThe conversation today with Sorkin represented the most prominent media appearance SBF has made since the implosion of FTT–the exchange’s native token–resulted in a flurry of withdrawals that caused the company to buckle. The exchange, which was valued at $32.2 billion, shuttered just a handful of days after its sister company Alameda’s balance sheet was leaked.\nThose financial records revealed that Alameda’s assets were largely made up of FTX-issued FTT tokens and other highly illiquid digital currencies. Following the leak, Changpeng Zhao, CEO of rival exchange Binance and a former investor in FTX, announced that his company would begin selling its share of FTT tokens, which it received as part of its divestment from FTX last year.\nZhao’s move shook consumer confidence in FTX, and as investors rushed to sell their own FTT tokens and withdraw funds from the exchange, the run forced FTX to admit that it did not hold one-to-one reserves of customer assets, ultimately leading to its collapse.\nWhen FTX filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this month, SBF was replaced by John J. Ray III, who oversaw the bankruptcy of Enron and other major corporate failures. FTX’s new leader has called the situation “unprecedented” for the company’s lack of clear financials or corporate controls.\nAD\nAD\nAt one point in the interview, SBF said he was still “looking through what happened” to the exchange, despite not having a position at the company anymore.\nBefore launching FTX, SBF founded the trading firm Alameda Research. While he had maintained the two entities operated separately from each other, it has since been revealed that billions of dollars worth of customer funds from FTX had been loaned out to Alameda to compensate for the firm’s trading losses.\nSBF is being confronted with concerns of fraud and mismanagement in the wake of his exchange’s collapse. Reporting for Reuters alleged FTX had a “back door” built into it that enabled funds to be funneled away without raising red flags. SBF has denied the allegations.\nThe day FTX filed for bankruptcy, $650 million in crypto assets went missing from the exchange, and it remains unclear how the funds were taken from FTX. In an interview with Tiffany Fong published Tuesday, SBF suggested it could’ve been a former employee or someone who had installed malware on a former employee’s computer.\nThe company currently owes its largest creditors over $3 billion and its demise had led to fears of contagion within the industry. The loss of funds caused crypto lender Genesis to pause withdrawals, citing \"unprecedented market turmoil,\" and forced BlockFi to file for bankruptcy on Monday.\nFTX had grown rapidly to become the second-largest exchange after it was launched in 2019. It had cemented itself as a recognizable name in crypto through Super Bowl advertisements, celebrity endorsements, and securing the naming rights to the stadium where the NBA’s Miami Heat plays.\nPrior to his downfall, SBF drew comparisons to John Pierpont Morgan for his role in bailing out embattled companies native to the industry during this summer’s crypto meltdown. In recent weeks, his legacy has been likened to fraudsters such as Elizabeth Holmes and Bernie Madoff.\nSBF said his bailouts from over the summer were not intended to preserve the value of FTT and maintained they were for the sake of the industry. “I wanted to keep the industry stable, but I didn’t think it had any FTT-specific impact,” he said.\nWhat else did SBF say?\nOn regulation: “There’s a bunch of bullshit that regulated companies do to try and look good,” he said, adding FTX was engaged in cultivating a favorable public image similar to that of other large companies.\nReflecting on the crash: “I’ve had a bad month,” he said, to which the DealBook crowd laughed in response.\nAD\nAD\nOn philanthropy: “My donations were mostly for pandemic prevention,” he said when asked about the nature of his donations to various political campaigns. “It was on both sides of the isles. I was not viewing it as a partisan exercise.”\nSBF said that the donations he made came from profits, not customer funds.\nSBF was asked questions about funds he gave to different media companies and whether he was giving to them to get preferential treatment in the press.\n“I was looking to support journalists doing great work because I think what they do is really important,” he said, adding the media focus on him has been just. “I think it’s healthy for the world that there is real investigative journalism.”\nOn real estate in the Bahamas: “It was not intended to be their long term property,” SBF said in reference to his parents’ property in the Bahamas. “I don’t know how that was paid for.”\nOn risk management: “A lot of what we ended up doing and focusing on was a distraction from one extremely important area, and that was risk,” he said. “There absolutely were management failures.”\n“I think a lot of [the issues] were on the risk management side.”\nOn the polycule: “There were no wild parties here,” he said. “We would play board games.”\nOn amphetamine use: “I have been prescribed various things at various times to help with concentration,” he said. “I wish I had been more focused over the past year.”\nOn how much money is left: “I don’t have any hidden funds,” he said, adding that he’s down to one bank account with about $100,000 in it. “I put everything I had into FTX.”\nAD\nAD\nOn whether he’s ever lied: “There were certainly times … when I acted as a marketer for FTX.\""}, {"date": "2022-11-30 22:57:07", "entity": ["bitcoin", "ftx", "ftx", "coindesk", "alameda capital", "ftx", "band", "ltc"], "sentiment": ["Negative", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Positive", "Positive"], "content": "But November is dismal: Bitcoin fell in value by more than 18% for the month and ether tumbled 21% amid the collapse of crypto exchange giant FTX and the ensuing fallout.

Even if some crypto companies didn’t always agree with his take on regulation, such as with the supposedly \"DeFi killing\" Stabenow-Boozman bill that SBF backed, his growing influence in Washington had at least made it easier for people to talk to lawmakers about crypto.\nAlthough she’s lived outside the U.S. for most of the past five years, she said it’s clear that a lot of doors in D.C. have closed.\n“He was vaunted as this figure who was like a serious person, whereas everyone else in the industry is painted as some sort of whack job loony tune,” she said of former FTX CEO Bankman-Fried. “It was kind of beneficial that there was at least one person who was seemingly credible in the eyes of people who do have the ears of lawmakers and people who incorporate policy. Yeah, a lot of that goodwill is gone now.”\nTezos was launched in 2016 after a hacker stole $50 million from The DAO, the first decentralized autonomous organization on the Ethereum network, by exploiting a flaw in its smart contract. The fallout led to the creation of the current Ethereum network, which erased the illicit transactions, while the Ethereum Classic network preserved the hacker’s transactions.\nIt was a very contentious decision. To the Breitmans, the hack and the Ethereum hard fork, which split the network in two, underscored the need for a new governance structure—which they'd previously written about in the Tezos position paper—that would allow token holders to have a say in how a blockchain develops.\nEven outside the scope of policy and regulation, she said Bankman-Fried came to be the archetype for how the industry expected companies to operate: Doing big, aggressive deals, creating a strong narrative, and finding gregarious people to share them.\n“For the last two years, it's been a little bit maddening, because I suppose when Sam Bankman Fried and FTX kind of came on the scene, they were sort of happy warriors; they were making really aggressive plays to scoop up companies that weren't getting a lot of profitability but were getting a lot of traction,” Breitman said.\nAD\nAD\nShe added that, at the time, Bankman-Fried’s moves seemed both novel and aggressive, and made her question whether she was going about things the wrong way.\n“The Tezos Foundation and Tezos ecosystem have been reticent to do these sort of hamfisted, heavy valuations, pre-pre-product, pre-pre-revenue venture deals. And so I felt like I was taking crazy pills,” said Breitman, “because this person had been anointed the new hot thing and raised $1.8 billion in funding at kind of record speed.”\nBreitman said, echoing many others in the industry, that the way Bankman-Fried jumped into deals with crypto lender BlockFi and asset manager Voyager Digital after the Terra collapse in May was a huge red flag.\n“This was sort of a watershed moment for me to see who kind of came to the rescue of that,” she said. It was when “the FTX Hydra” started aggressively seeking deals with what Breitman called “really poorly, fundamentally poorly built businesses” that the questions began. \"It made me second guess both the intention and the morality of them as a business operator,\" she said.\nEditor's note: This story was updated after publication to clarify that the Tezos position paper was published before the Ethereum hard fork following The DAO hack.\nListen and subscribe to the gm podcast wherever you get your podcasts."}, {"date": "2022-11-30 20:46:38", "entity": ["telegram", "durov", "telegram", "durov", "ftx", "telegram", "telegram", "ftx", "ftx", "alameda research", "##ano durov", "blockfi", "genesis", "jp morgan", "ftx", "gemini", "okx", "crypto. com", "ftx"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative"], "content": "As the collapse of the crypto exchange FTX shakes faith in the industry’s centralized players, Telegram is stepping in to build trustless and decentralized alternatives.\nIn his Telegram channel on Wednesday, Pavel Durov—the messaging platform’s founder and CEO—announced that the company would begin building “non-custodial wallets” and “decentralized exchanges” that would let millions of users safely trade their crypto.\nAD\nAD\n“This way we can fix the wrongs caused by the excessive centralization, which let down hundreds of thousands of cryptocurrency users,” said Durov.\nThe executive argued that the project should be more than feasible: the development of Fragment, Telegram’s decentralized auction platform, “took only 5 weeks and 5 people, including myself,” according to Durov.\nThe marketplace, which launched last month, has already raked in $50 million worth of Toncoin by selling tokenized usernames on the blockchain. It operates over The Open Network (TON)—the spiritual successor of Telegram’s former blockchain ambitions that were squashed by the SEC years ago.\nRallying the developer community, Durov called for steering the industry back towards decentralized applications and away from having to trust third parties. Reliance on centralized entities, he said, caused many to lose their money in FTX’s bankruptcy at “the hands of a few who began to abuse their power.”\nFTX has been accused of mismanaging client funds by lending them out to its sister trading desk Alameda Research—a no-no for firms in the exchange business. Other exchanges are now scrambling to implement better checks and balances at their firms, including proof of reserves systems that attempt to verify possession of client funds on-chain.\nCardano founder Charles Hoskinson echoed Durov’s same argument regarding FTX at the Financial Times Crypto and Digital Assets Summit on Wednesday.\n“The failures we’re having aren’t failures of protocols, aren’t failures of DeFi,” Hoskinson said. “They’re failures of trust, they’re failures of regulation, they’re failures of people.”\nCrypto users appear to feel the same.

As Decrypt wrote in August, the SEC and Chair Gary Gensler have \"shifted from rhetoric to enforcement,\" with an eye on current and past projects alike that the agency believes violated securities law.\nBy launching or marketing a project before obtaining the input of crypto-savvy lawyers that closely follow the evolving regulatory landscape, Web3 builders only amplify the potential risk they face down the line.\n\"You can't take that back,\" Rubin said of crypto marketing claims. It's better to make necessary tweaks during the building stage, in her view, as opposed to after the launch—when such legal issues could threaten the aims or functionality of the project.\nIn July, the SEC said it was opening an investigation into Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange operating in the United States, alleging that the company listed nine tokens that the agency considers unregistered securities. Coinbase has denied the agency’s claims.\nIn November, the SEC won its case against LBRY when a court determined that the company committed securities violations by launching and selling its native LBRY Credits (LBC) token.\nMany in the space see the advance of federal regulators and a lack of clear regulation as signs that more and more U.S.-based crypto projects will relocate to crypto-friendlier countries. However, Rubin said that this will not necessarily protect Web3 developers from the long arm of American law enforcement.\n\"This is a misconception,” she explained, “because even if a company forms abroad, it's possible that they could be subject to U.S. laws if they are dealing with U.S. customers or doing business in the U.S.\"\nAD\nAD\nIn September, the SEC sent shockwaves through the crypto space when the agency claimed that it had the right to sue Ian Balina, a crypto influencer, for failing to register a cryptocurrency as a security in 2018.\nBalina’s case is controversial in part because the agency alluded that the U.S. government has jurisdiction over all transactions on the Ethereum network. Rubin said that now is the time for builders to pay close attention to what is happening with Congress and the SEC.\nThere could be tricky times ahead for crypto builders, depending on regulators’ next moves, but it’s sure to provide plenty of opportunities for attorneys who specialize in the sector.\n“It is very exciting,” Rubin said of crypto law. \"The law is a bit of a gray area, and it moves fast.\""}, {"date": "2022-11-30 17:00:00", "entity": ["ftx", "coin ftx exchange", "dex"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The introduction of this DEX comes at a shaky time for the crypto ecosystem, which is still reeling from the collapse of centralized exchange FTX.

This resulted in significantly lower trading volumes and fewer client sign-ups,” Powell wrote. “We responded by slowing hiring efforts and avoiding large marketing commitments. Unfortunately, negative influences on the financial markets have continued and we have exhausted preferable options for bringing costs in line with demand.”\nThe layoffs bring the exchange’s total headcount down from about 3,667 to 2,567 employees. Powell said that Kraken has now returned to the same number of staff it had about a year ago, and had expanded by 30% when Kraken saw “millions of new clients” during the bull market.\nThe bear market has claimed several victims in the crypto space this year following the collapse of Terra in May.

Per Neuman, it was existing users’ overwhelming demand for Ethereum support that prompted led the company to expand its offerings.\n“We've continued to have our members ask us for Ethereum support over the last two years, to a point where it became very clear to us that this was a huge need not just for our customers, but also for the broader community,” Neuman told Decrypt.\nInitially, Casa leadership had its doubts about Ethereum’s staying power and centrality to the crypto ecosystem. But, Neuman conceded, a lot has changed since 2018.\n“The Ethereum ecosystem has evolved significantly since then, and proven out some things that were questions for us early on,” Neuman said. “Everything from the trustworthiness of multisig smart contracts, which we are building on top of, to the number of people building in the ecosystem, to the size of the community.”\nCasa offers a free-to-use Casa Wallet app for retail Bitcoin holders, and a new, revamped version of the app will debut in January with both Bitcoin and Ethereum compatibility. The firm also offers more advanced security services for paying customers with larger holdings, and will roll out additional membership tiers in 2023.\nAll plans offered by Casa are fundamentally premised on users retaining custody of their own crypto assets.\nIn the wake of the shocking collapse of crypto exchange FTX earlier this month, skepticism has grown of centralized crypto firms that act as traditional banking intermediaries for crypto assets. Companies like Casa say that the ability for any crypto holder to control their own money is fundamental to the concept and promise of crypto.is.\nWhile Neuman is in no way pleased with the fact that billions of dollars worth of FTX users’ funds are currently trapped, or possibly forever lost, within the now-bankrupt company’s murky mechanisms, he does think the calamity could provide a silver lining for self-custody advocates.\nAD\nAD\n“This is a bit of a validation of what we've been saying all along,” Neuman said. “The best way to secure your assets, to have real control over your digital wealth, is to hold the keys yourself.”\nNeuman is hopeful that recent events will serve as a wakeup call for all crypto holders—tech-savvy and casual investors alike—to embrace the industry's earliest principle: decentralization. And he’s confident that the current dominance of once-FTX rivals like Coinbase and Binance will soon be a thing of the past.\n“This concentration of customer base around centralized custodians will probably be a blip,” Neuman said. “Will they ever go away completely?

Genie users that made more than one transaction before April 15 will be eligible for $300 each, while holders of Genie's Genesis NFTs or Genie Gem NFTs will be eligible for $1,000 each.\nUniswap’s NFT aggregator encompasses listings and data from OpenSea, X2Y2, Sudoswap, LooksRare, Larva Labs, Foundation, and NFT20. Gray said Uniswap can add more in the future, but most marketplaces store their data off-chain. This means Uniswap would need those marketplaces’ cooperation to obtain the API keys needed to add them to its site.\nWhy use an aggregator? While OpenSea remains the most popular NFT marketplace, the tides may be changing. As more and more NFT marketplaces launch, the trading experience becomes more complicated and spread out as users set up accounts on multiple marketplaces.\nGray thinks such market fragmentation is actually a good thing for decentralization—and aggregators simplify an otherwise overwhelming shopping experience.\n“I think it’s safe to have all this fragmentation as long as you have a really good aggregator because it allows for the users and the creators to be in control rather than the platform,” Gray told Decrypt.\nAD\nAD\n“And we won’t end up in a situation like the [Apple] App Store where they can take down anything, or right now, for example, they're basically limiting the NFT space because they want 30% of every NFT sale.”\nUniswap’s aggregator won’t enforce creator fees, which have become a hot-button topic as various marketplaces announce they will (or won’t) be enforcing creator fees for secondary sales.\n“Creator fees have been a huge catalyst for the NFT space,” Gray acknowledged, but clarified that Uniswap won’t enforce such fees through its platform.\n“As an aggregator, we don't have the ability to set creator fees, or enforce creator fees, because we're not creating listings on our side,” he said. “But in light of that, we made it really easy for users to filter out which marketplaces they want to use, or they don't want to use.”\nGray also believes aggregators like Uniswap’s could help bring about mass adoption.\n“If we have a ton of information asymmetry, and a lot of capital inefficiency in the NFT buying experience, then we're not going to get the mainstream adoption that we need in the space,” he said.\n“I see an aggregator like Uniswap more like Google Search, where we’re directing traffic to where it's most efficient.”\nUniswap’s aggregator will be open-source, meaning anyone can contribute suggestions for improvements to its protocol and interface through GitHub.\nyour NFT marketplace is closed sourced? pic.twitter.com/lsCi2Zndfy — Scott.weth 🦄 (@Scott_eth) November 29, 2022\nWhen asked if Uniswap will add any of its own fees to its aggregator in the future, Gray said there are currently no plans to do so.\nAD\nAD\nWhile the aggregator will only support Ethereum NFTs at launch, it’s possible more may be added down the line.\n“We definitely have on our radar to expand to more chains,” Gray said.\nUniswap’s shiny new aggregator isn’t its first foray into NFTs, however. The DEX previously launched a limited collection of “phygital” Ethereum NFTs called Unisocks, which are digital socks that can be “burned” and redeemed for an IRL physical pair.\nWhen asked why the sock NFTs still cost roughly $20,000, Gray called them “a meme.”\n“Hayden is still doing hand deliveries for Unisocks,” Gray said of Hayden Adams, Uniswap’s inventor and Uniswap Labs CEO. “It has become like a meme for Ethereum OGs and large Uniswap supporters.”"}, {"date": "2022-11-30 13:55:36", "entity": ["bitcoin", "european central bank", "ecb", "bitcoin", "ftx", "btc", "european central bank", "ecb", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "ad", "bindseil", "cbdc", "central bank", "ecb", "cbdc", "bitcoin", "ecb", "cbdc", "cbdc", "bindseil", "schaff", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bitcoin", "bindseil", "schaff", "bitcoin", "bitcoin"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Negative", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "The seeming stabilization of the price of Bitcoin (BTC) at levels around $20,000 in the months before the FTX collapse was “an artificially induced last gasp before the road to irrelevance.”\nMoreover, this was “already foreseeable” before the fallout of the crypto exchange, which last week sent BTC to a two-year low of under $16,000, according to the European Central Bank (ECB).\nAD\nAD\nThe apparent stabilisation of bitcoin’s value is likely to be an artificially induced last gasp before the crypto-asset embarks on a road to irrelevance. #TheECBblog looks at where bitcoin stands amid widespread volatility in the crypto markets.\nRead more https://t.co/Hk1LuYX2de pic.twitter.com/I3Uidks8Xo — European Central Bank (@ecb) November 30, 2022\nIn a blog post, ECB’s Market Infrastructure & Payments Director General Ulrich Bindseil and advisor Jürgen Schaff also argue that “Bitcoin's conceptual design and technological shortcomings make it questionable as a means of payment.”\nAccording to Bindseil and Schaff, Bitcoin transactions are “cumbersome, slow and expensive,” which they say explains why the world’s largest cryptocurrency—created to overcome the existing monetary and financial system—\"has never been used to any significant extent for legal real-world transactions.”\nBitcoin 'should not be legitimized'\nThe authors also compared Bitcoin’s historical price cycles to speculative bubbles, which rely on new money flowing in.\n“Bitcoin has also repeatedly benefited from waves of new investors. The manipulations by individual exchanges or stablecoin providers etc., during the first waves are well documented,” reads the blog.\nBindseil and Schaff added that since Bitcoin is neither an effective payment system nor a form of investment, “it should be treated as neither in regulatory terms and thus should not be legitimized.”\n“Similarly, the financial industry should be wary of the long-term damage of promoting Bitcoin investments - despite short-term profits they could make (even without their skin in the game),” reads the blog, pointing to reputational risks for financial institutions.\nNotably, today’s blog post went live the next day after Brazil, the world’s seventh most populous country, passed a law legalizing cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as means of payment.\nAD\nAD\nCo-author Bindseil has earlier published several research papers on CBDCs, an acronym for central bank’s digital currencies—digital versions of a state’s fiat currency.\nECB itself is playing an active role in developing the digital euro, with president Christine Lagarde stating that a European CBDC could complement traditional cash and \"provide an alternative to private digital currencies\" like Bitcoin.\nAccording to ECB’s research last year, CBDCs could also help lower banks' interest rates, make transactions smoother and faster, and minimize cash use.\nMany crypto proponents, however, argue that CBDCs bear significant risks, such as the elimination of financial privacy, increased surveillance over individuals, and the ability to block or censor any transaction."}, {"date": "2022-11-30 13:28:09", "entity": ["ftx", "texas state securities board", "ftx us", "ftx", "ftx us", "ftx capital markets llc"], "sentiment": ["Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral", "Neutral"], "content": "Sam Bankman-Fried has been called to an FTX hearing by a Texas securities regulator.
