# FinEntity

A Dataset for **entity-level sentiment** classification.

🤗 [huggingface dataloader](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yixuantt/FinEntity)

Please note that some hyper-parameters may affect the performance, which can vary among different tasks/environments/software/hardware; thus, careful tunning is required. 

## Instruction
In the financial domain, conducting entity-level sentiment analysis is crucial for accurately assessing the sentiment directed toward a specific financial entity. To our knowledge, no publicly available dataset currently exists for this purpose. In this work, we introduce an entity-level sentiment classification dataset, called **FinEntity**, that annotates sentiment (positive, neutral, and negative) of individual financial entities in financial news. The dataset construction process is well-documented in the paper.
Additionally, we benchmark several pre-trained models (BERT, FinBERT, etc.) and ChatGPT on entity-level sentiment classification and find out that fine-tuning pre-trained models outperform ChatGPT. In a case study, we demonstrate the practical utility of using FinEntity in monitoring cryptocurrency markets.
